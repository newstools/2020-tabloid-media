The GO! Durban project – road construction along the Phoenix highway has resumed as the country moved to Level 3 of the lockdown, amid the fight to contain the Covid-19 outbreak. GO! Durban is eThekwini Municipality’s Integrated Rapid Public Transport Network (IRPTN) to create a safer, more efficient and affordable commuter experience for residents. The massive project will see nine transport corridors developed and linked by various modes of transport. Phoenix falls under the C9 corridor which is 14 kilometers in total and runs from Bridge City to Umhlanga. Ward 49 Councillor, Tino Pillay, urged residents to exercise patience and caution during construction as the project will take some time to complete. “We are struggling in terms of traffic delays in and out of Phoenix and this project will definitely enhance the betterment of road users as it will lessen traffic and help all residents in the long term. When it comes to progress, in anything, there are hiccups but we have to oversee that and look at the bigger picture and the end result,” said Cllr Pillay. GO! Durban plans to extend of the highway into four lanes (minimum) and a maximum of six lanes which will include a rapid transport bus system for commuters with bus shelters at various points of the highway for the collection of commuters.
