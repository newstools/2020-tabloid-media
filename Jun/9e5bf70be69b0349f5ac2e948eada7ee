The KZN Health MEC, Nomagugu Simelane-Zulu announced Clairwood Hospital as the latest addition to the province’s quarantine and isolation centres. The MEC was joined by head of department, Doctor Sandile Tshabalala and representatives of organized labour at the launch held at Clairwood Hospital on 2 June. Simelane-Zulu said the Covid-19 facility, which was refurbished in just two months, will enable 154 patients to be isolated and about 40 to be quarantined. It also has technological advancements such as doors programmed to only permit entry for people with an appropriate temperature and who are wearing a mask as well as a wash bay to sanitise ambulances immediately after dropping off Covid-19 patients. MEC Simelane-Zulu said, “Although we are also investing in field hospitals that will be placed in several venues such as the Pietermaritzburg Royal Show grounds and the Durban Exhibition Centre, renovating our own facilities is a must so that our facilities are useful for even after the pandemic. We also want to make sure that our facilities meet National Health Insurance (NHI) requirements so that they can be accredited.” The MEC also announced the recruitment of thousands of various categories of employees who will work in Covid-19 wards for the next six months, and possibly beyond. In one of their biggest and most significant HR recruitment drives ever, they have advertised 4773 posts in the following categories, 2408 Professional Nurses, 1968 Enrolled Nurses, 230 General Orderlies, 70 Ward Clerks and 97 ICU nurses. The posts have been advertised on the Department’s official website: www.kznhealth.gov.za
