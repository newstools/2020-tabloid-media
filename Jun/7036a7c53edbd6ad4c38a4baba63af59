The Best of Carvin H Goldstone Comedy Show is now going to be streamed for the first time on 4 July at 7pm on Quicket. It is a family friendly show that has no swearing or vulgarity and is suitable for the whole family. It’s about South Africa, Durban, race, Karens, Indian and coloured family and a touch of South African politics. In 2018, Carvin H Goldstone was voted as the best comedian in South Africa, by the rest of the comedians of South Africa. He won the Comics Choice Comedian of the year award, the highest honour in South African comedy. He also won the Flying Solo award. A big part of that victory was Carvin’s world tour, which changed his comedy forever. But before Carvin went global, he recorded one last show which has never been seen before and that is Best of Carvin H Goldstone Comedy Show.
