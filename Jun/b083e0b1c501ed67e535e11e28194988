The campaign is on for KwaZulu-Natal beauty Jamie Lee Diedre Harris to be the next Miss South Africa. Harris, 24, from the south of KZN is a final year Bachelor of Law student as well as an entrepreneur and model. Harris said fighting for women’s rights is one of her passions and the reason that she was drawn in to law. “I seek to advance women’s rights by advocating for a legislative change to proactively promote the economic participation of women across all sectors. I aim to use this platform to defend the rights of vulnerable women and to promote their access to justice and equitable resources,” she said. Harris will in August take the stage with 34 other hopefuls in a bid to bring the tittle home, back to the south of Durban. Inspired by media mogul and former Miss SA, Basetsana Kumalo, Harris has also entered the fashion industry by modeling and by becoming a fashion entrepreneur specialising in female tailored suits. She said: “As Miss South Africa I would have the ability to effect change where previously I did not have the platform to do so. I believe that our talents are purposely created not just for ourselves but to help those around us. “My talent is having a leading voice to empower woman through advocating for legislative changes to proactively promote the economic participation of woman.” Harris said that she would like to see in SA proactive changes to the economic participation of women across all sectors, as women make up 51.2% of the country’s population. “There should be mandatory regulations of 51.2% female involvement across all sectors and senior positions. I am passionate about women equality and enriching their lives. I aim to empower, inspire and celebrate women and young girls. I believe that I am the ideal representative to address inequality, injustice and confront sexism,” Harris added.
