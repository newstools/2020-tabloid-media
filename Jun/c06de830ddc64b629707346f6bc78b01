The opening of schools against the tide of the coronavirus has suffered yet another setback this week. It is believed that a teacher at Seatides Combined School in Tongaat tested positive for the novel coronavirus (Covid-19). A pupil who asked to remain anonymous told Tongaat and Verulam Tabloid on Friday (26 June) that a teacher who was ill, tested positive for the coronavirus. “We were told to go back to our homes after the outbreak of the virus at the school,” said the pupil. When the school was phoned, a teacher who answered, said that he was advised by the principal to direct media enquiries to the provincial education department for comment. Muzi Mahlambi, spokesperson of the provincial education department, said that he was not aware of the Covid-19 case at the school. “In such cases, we normally close the school for three days to do disinfection. Risk assessments are conducted to determine what could be done to prevent further outbreaks,” he said. According to Mahlambi, more than 60 schools across the province have been closed after positive Covid-19 cases were reported.
