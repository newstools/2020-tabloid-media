A security officer has been fatally shot and robbed of his firearm while on duty at the Durban Unicity Electricity Department on Malacca Road in Redhill, a short while ago (Friday). Reaction Unit South Africa (Rusa) responded to the scene and Rusa head, Prem Balram, said: “While attending to a serious collision on the N2 at approximately 1.20pm, Reaction Officers received reports of the shooting. On arrival it was established that a security officer employed for a company based in Durban was shot and killed by a lone suspect. The deceased was then robbed of his firearm. The suspect was seen fleeing the scene on foot, however, it could not be confirmed if there was a getaway vehicle parked in the vicinity.” Balram said police are on scene and investigating further.
