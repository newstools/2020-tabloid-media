A COVID-19 wave is sweeping through the suburb of Overport and the thriving business and residential hub is deemed one of the 19 hotspots in KwaZulu-Natal. Speaking to Tabloid Newspapers, Ethekwini Secure, spokesperson, Zain Soosiwala, said: “There are about 24 or so cases known to me in the area within flats and houses and those affected are self-isolating with signs of recovery. Felix Dlamini Road (Brickfield Road) and Alpine Road remain 1 of 19 hotspots in KZN. Individuals who have tested positive are not pariahs or people needing to be ostracised. These are members of our community that deserve to be treated with civility.” “Reports are frequently emanating of COVID-19 cases in flats and businesses in Overport, however, more often than not it is fake news. The messages that are disseminated are being circulated for the purposes of creating panic. Do not be party to it,” Soosiwala said. “The community needs to take cognizance that the Coronavirus is real with real consequences. People need to take all necessary precautions when leaving home. Wear your masks, stop giving handouts / stop interacting with any vagrants and remember, people move the virus; it cannot do so on its own, so stay at home where possible. Now is not the time for complacency,” added Soosiwala. He said Sparkport Pharmacy was the most recent business which closed temporarily on Sunday after a staff member tested positive for COVID-19. Sparkport Pharmacy issued a statement on Facebook confirming that a staff member tested positive for the virus at the Overport branch and has not been to work for a week. The affected staffer is in self-isolation and all other staff members who was in contact with the positive employee have undergone testing and their results are awaited. Sparkport Pharmacy opened doors for business today after decontaminating and fogging the store.
