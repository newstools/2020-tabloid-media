After having his milestone 80th birthday dampened by the coronavirus (Covid-19) pandemic, Fred Moodley expressed his dismay as he could no longer participate in an array of marathons scheduled for this year. The Montford resident said that the novel coronavirus impacted his birthday celebrations as well as his plans to run multiple marathons this year. “My birthday was on 7 May, during the Level 4 national lockdown. It was because of the tough restrictions that I could not celebrate as I would have liked to. “I was planning on flying to Australia through Mauritius to spend time with my family but the restrictions imposed on the country prevented me from doing so,” said Moodley. In his sporting career, spanning over 50 years, Moodley has successfully won the 10km Road Race in the 75 years and over category in 2015 as well as participated in the World Masters Championship in Brisbane 10 years ago, completing the marathon in four hours and 10 minutes. He has also completed seven Comrades Marathons and seven Two Oceans Marathons as well as handfuls of minor races. The Gemsports Athletic Club member was looking forward to participating in the 80-year category during this year’s club events. “All registered sports clubs were unable to have their sports events due to the restrictions imposed by the government as a result of the coronavirus. This will definitely negatively affect the up-keep of athletic clubs,” said Moodley. Despite his disappointment, Moodley said that he is grateful that his loved ones have been spared from the effects of Covid-19. “I just would like to thank the Lord that none of my family or friends have been affected by the coronavirus and that they are all safe,” said the athlete.
