Entrances may be reduced due to sanitization processes. Airports will have markings on the floor for social distancing of 1.5 metres at check-in counters, security checkpoints and airport lounges. Airline check-in agents will wear face shields and the counters will be installed with protective screens.  Check-in counters will also be frequently sanitized. Port Health will conduct screening checks at entrances. Passengers must produce their business travel permission letters at the entrance. Passengers are encouraged to use self-check-in to avoid queues at the airport. Boarding will be staggered and prioritized in terms of the number of passengers to board. Inside the cabin No catering will be allowed; No magazines on board; The last row will be reserved for isolation of suspected cases. Loading capacity for airport buses is limited to 70. Limited parkade options will be available. Baggage wrapping is compulsory for all check-in luggage for hygiene reasons. Check-in process Passengers should check in online before going to the airport.
Online check in can be done at the screens in the terminal building.
A limited number of check-in counters will be open and physical distancing rules will apply in these queues. Security checkpoint process Passengers will scan their own paper-based or mobile device-based boarding pass to the scanner at the security checkpoint.
Passengers should remove any metal and electronic items from their person before entering the security queue. This includes mobile devices, watches, jewellery, wallets, keys etc. These items must be placed in the tray at the security scanner.
This process will minimise the need for security officers to conduct physical pat downs at the checkpoint. “These regulations are there for the protection of all people and we expect absolute compliance.  We understand the need to gradually open the economy, and we are balancing it with safety and good health.  I am confident that our airports will play a central role in reigniting the economy, reconnecting our economic hubs while strictly operating under these conditions, “said Mbalula.
