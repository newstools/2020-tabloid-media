A suspect has been arrested and appeared in the Durban Magistrate’s Court on Tuesday, following the heinous rape of a Chesterville grandmother, 51, and her granddaughter,7, in the early hours of Sunday morning. Police spokesperson, Col Thembeka Mbele said: “The victims were inside the house and sleeping at around midnight. The suspect came and knocked on the door and the woman opened the door as the suspect is well known to them. The grandchildren aged 7 and 12 were sleeping in the house. The suspect took out a knife and threatened them. The suspect raped the grandmother and the granddaughter. The 12-year-old escaped and raised the alarm. The accused was later arrested in the Point area.” KwaZulu-Natal Social Development MEC Nonhlanhla Khoza strongly condemned the vicious deed and said it was pleasing to see a swift arrest from the police. She said: “We strongly condemn this, and we will be closely watching this case when it goes to court. Police have done great work in this case. We urge communities to partner with police to end this disturbing trend.” According to Khoza, social workers were assigned to provide psychosocial support to the victims.
