It was all systems go for Grade 7 and 12 pupils at Rose Heights Primary who returned to school on Monday, 8 June. After two months of being away from school, the pupils returned to their new-normal of social distancing and the wearing of masks. According to the Department of Education regulations, only pupils and staff are allowed on school premises, which saw parents reluctantly leave their children at the school gates. This is to minimise the risk of Covid-19 infection, to both pupils and staff. Information had been circulated to parents, by some schools, that they should wait in the parking areas until their children have been screened. They were also informed that the pupils had to be fetched immediately after school. Speaking to The Chatsworth Tabloid, school principal Doctor Rishi Budhal said: “We did not experience any challenges as we have been preparing for this day, one month in advance. Our staff, pupils, parents and transporters have been through the proper orientation process for readiness.” Budhal said that it was a good start to the rest of the term. “We are very optimistic that teaching and learning will continue as per the department’s plans. However, I am concerned that many schools are still not Covid-19 compliant. We have also been proactive and contacted our school transport companies and schooled them on the different transport measures and regulations,” he said. Most schools had been given personal protective equipment. Out of 6 000 schools in KwaZulu-Natal, a total of 5 975 were found ready to open by the department. Schools that were not ready to open, plans have been put in place to ensure no child is left behind.
