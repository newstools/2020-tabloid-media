Former Umhlatuzana glamour girl, Karishma Ramdev, is one of among 34 other contestants vying for the coveted title of Miss South Africa 2020. The beauty queen who will be representing KwaZulu-Natal in the first of its kind virtual pageant, said that becoming Miss SA is a dream that she hopes to make come true. “I remember as a little girl walking into a grocery store with my mom and looking at the latest You magazine which featured a strong, fierce, beautiful woman and telling my mother that I wanted to be just like her,” Ramdev said. Inspired by the likes of former title holders like Joanne Strauss, Ramdev said she cannot believe that her dream is soon becoming a reality. “For as long as I can remember I have always looked up to the previous Miss South Africa title holders and have taken so much inspiration and motivation from the powerful woman they are,” said Ramdev. The 25-year-old boasts more than just a pretty smile as she is a qualified medical doctor, working at the Charlotte Maxeke Johannesburg Academic Hospital. Though she grew up as a ‘tomboy’, Ramdev jokes that if she won the Miss SA title, the first person she would love to meet would be Queen Elizabeth II for advice on how to keep her crown so shiny. Ramdev advises young women to be strong during this trying times that the country is facing during the covid-19 pandemic. “Do not feel like the country has given up on you. Let what is happening in this country to women be the fuel that starts the fire within your heart to make a change. One person alone cannot change the trajectory and views of women in society, but together we can make a difference,” said Ramdev. Miss South Africa 2020 is the 62nd edition of the pageant. It will be held in August. Sasha-Lee Olivier of Gauteng will crown her successor at the end of the event, having taken over the reign from Zozibini Tunzi who relinquished the title after she was crowned Miss Universe in 2019.
