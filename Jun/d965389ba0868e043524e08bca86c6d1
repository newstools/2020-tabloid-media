Rumours are doing their rounds that the ban on liquor sales will be reinstated, sending many that enjoy their social alcoholic beverage into a flat spin. According to government these rumors can be treated as fake news. Department of Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs (Cogta) spokesperson Lungi Mtshali said WhatsApp voice notes and messages circulating recently, which claim a decision had been taken to reimpose the prohibition on the sale of alcohol are fake. Mtshali confirmed the rumours were nothing more than misinformation. “Cabinet has not even met since the regulations came into effect, so there hasn’t even been a discussion on the matter,” Mtshali said. The sale of alcohol was banned under the Level 5 lockdown, which was enforced on 26 March, and it remained in place during Level 4 of the lockdown. The ban was finally lifted on 1 June when the lockdown Level 3 regulations came into effect, albeit under strict conditions on specified days and for limited hours.
