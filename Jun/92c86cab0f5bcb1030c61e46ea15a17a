The extremely cold weather did not deter runners from the Phoenix Villagers Athletic Club (PVAC) from participating in the historical Race, The Comrades Legends hosted by the Comrades Marathon Association on Sunday, 14 June. Members proudly donned the PVAC kit and turned out in their numbers at their chosen start venues to run their planned routes. Public relations officer (PRO) at the Phoenix Villagers Athletic Club, Thayer Hoosen Latiff said that the Comrades Marathon Association’s ‘Race The Comrades Legends’ is a running concept based on the stories of the greatest Comrades legends in history, where each participant creates their own personal story and on completion is able to earn a real medal. “Due to the Covid-19 pandemic, the 2020 edition of the Comrades Marathon, also known as the ultimate human race was called off. Instead, the Comrades Marathon Association devised a novel plan and the ‘virtual Comrades Marathon’ was born. This event saw at least 43 500 runners taking part in the event from 86 countries around the globe. To be part of this iconic race is phenomenal and PVAC athletes were ecstatic as they flooded social media with photos and comments of the race,” said Hoosen.
