An out-of-control truck and trailer has caused havoc on the N2 Umhlanga after crashing into oncoming vehicles and careening down an embankment where it finally halted in an open field, a short while ago (Friday). The truck driver and motorist of a Hyundai i20 sustained critical injuries. The Reaction Unit South Africa (RUSA) Operations Centre received a call from a passing motorist reporting the accident. RUSA boss, Prem Balram, said: “On arrival RUSA members found that several ambulance services and the Ethekwini Fire and Rescue Services were in attendance. The driver of a Hyundai i20 was seriously injured in the head on collision. The Hyundai i20 then crashed into a white Toyota Yaris. After the initial crash, the horse and trailer crossed the north bound lane of the freeway before it travelled several metres down an embankment and came to a stop in an open field. The Jaws of Life is being used to free the seriously injured driver from the truck.” “According to a witness, the truck was travelling south when it suddenly crossed the centre median and collided head on into the Hyundai i20. The north bound lane of the N2 is currently closed while Emergency Services render assistance to the injured,” added Balram. Netcare 911 media liaison officer, Shawn Herbst said: “Two occupants from the truck were treated on scene while Rescue Services used hydraulic tools to free them from the wreckage. One person from a vehicle was critically injured and a fourth patient from one of the light motor vehicles had sustained moderate injuries. Once stabilised all the patients were transported by various ambulance services to hospital for further treatment.”
