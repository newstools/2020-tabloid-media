A breakthrough in the heinous murder of elderly Overport grandmother, retired teacher and businesswoman, Premla Moodliar (72) has yielded the arrest of two suspects, one known to the deceased, today (Tuesday). Police spokesperson, Colonel Thembeka Mbele said investigating officers from the Provincial Investigation Unit worked throughout the night to solve the murder case that had baffled many in the quiet suburb of Overport. “Their resilience yielded positive results when two suspects aged 32 and 36 were arrested.
Police proceeded to Inanda where a 36-year-old man was arrested. A 32-year-old suspect was thereafter arrested in Overport,” added Col Mbele. “Their arrest emanates from an incident that occurred on 3 May 2020. It is alleged that Premla Moodley, 72, was found dead at her residence on Sparks Road in Overport. Her hands were bound with tape and her house was ransacked. A case of murder and robbery was opened at Mayville police station. It is alleged that one of the suspects worked at the building in which the deceased lived in,” said Col Mbele. “The docket was assigned to the Provincial Investigation Unit for investigation. The detectives worked tirelessly to solve the case. Two wrist watches were recovered from a 36-year-old man. The suspects will be charged for murder and robbery. They will appear in the Durban Magistrate’s Court tomorrow,” she said.
