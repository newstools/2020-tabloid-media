Following weeks of closure after the nation-wide lockdown, the Phoenix Millenium Market stall holders and Democratic Liberal Congress (DLC) leader, councillor Patrick Pillay recently welcomed the re-opening of the market. Pillay who went on an inspection at the market said that the lockdown stifled and left many stall holders struggling to make ends meet. “Since the country reduced its status to Level 3, stallholders can now operate within the strict confines of the lockdown regulations of maintaining social distancing, sanitising their stalls as frequently as possible and ensuring that all customers are wearing a mask. During a meeting with the stall holders, they raised some matters regarding their trading hours and accessibility of which I accelerated to the market administrator, Cathy Govender, who was very positive and efficient in resolving these issues,” said Pillay. He added: “The DLC declares that the market is safe. The market parking area is now open and patrons can park their vehicles in the secure parking area at the Millennium Market. In 2016, the market underwent major upgrade and renovations and hundreds of traders depend on the income generated from the market for their livelihoods, we encourage the community to continue to support these stall holders.”
