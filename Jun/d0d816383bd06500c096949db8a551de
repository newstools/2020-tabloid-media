Varsity College students recently helped the Domino Foundation to handover food parcels to communities where access to food is a challenge. Speaking to the Durban North News, public relations and events coordinator at the Varsity College, Nandi Mzobe said that the gesture made by the foundation came at a perfect time when vulnerable communities are in dire need due to the current pandemic. She said that the two council university students, Liam Mcillroy and Slater Capel applied and were determined to share their sense of citizenship and social responsibility by working together with The Domino Foundation to pack and deliver food parcels. “The food parcels included non-perishable food items such as tinned fish, baked beans, maize meal, powdered milk, rice and oil. We appreciate the foundation for coming forward and involving the students in an initiative that uplift and also put smiles on peoples faces,” she said. Student, Slater Capel, said that the love of giving back to the vulnerable began when he started going to the St Anthony Church which happens to be on the same building as the Domino Foundation. “When I made my first visit at the foundation, I realised that this was something that I wanted to do. The current project that we are working on is to help out in collecting and packaging the food parcels during our short break from our studies,” he said. According to Capel, the food parcels are going to be distributed to vulnerable communities, including schools and child headed families.
