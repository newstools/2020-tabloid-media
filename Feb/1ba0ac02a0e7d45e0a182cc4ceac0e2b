The trial following the 2017 murder of a Doonside shop owner during an armed robbery finally concluded in the Durban High Court, where Dillyn Adams, 18 was sentenced to 12 years imprisonment for murder and 10 years for robbery.Police spokesperson, Colonel Thembeka Mbele said, “His co-accused, Sakhile Zamane Mtolo, 33 was sentenced to 15 years imprisonment for murder and  robbery. “They were also declared unfit to possess a firearm. Their sentence follows after the court heard how they attacked a shop owner at Doonside, in Amanzimtoti.”“It is alleged on 12 June 2017, the accused entered a supermarket at Doonside where they held up the two victims inside the store. “One of the accused jumped over the counter and stole cash from the till. As they were about to exit the store, they shot 26-year-old Rahman Manburbur before they fled the scene. The victim succumbed to the gunshot wound sustained. After an intensive investigation the culprits involved were apprehended and tried in court,” said Mbele.“It is heart-warming for the family to learn that those responsible for the killing are behind bars. The sterling investigation conducted is commended,” said the KwaZulu-Natal Provincial Commissioner, Lieutenant General Khombinkosi Jula.
