Ladysmith Police are investigating a case of culpable homicide, after one person was tragically killed and another was critically injured, in a single vehicle collision on the N11, just after the D45 turn-off, on Thursday (6 February). Various responding paramedics were called to the collision, which was reported in the late afternoon. It is alleged that the driver, a male who was presumed to be in his twenties, lost control of the vehicle, rolling it and coming to a abrupt stop on its roof in a major water storm drain along the shoulder of the road. The Jaws of Life had to be used to extricate the critically injured passenger who was also a male presumed to be in his twenties.  The injured passenger was stabilized before being transported by awaiting ambulances to a nearby hospital. The deceased has not yet been officially identified. SAPS said that  investigations are underway.
