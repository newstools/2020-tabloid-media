During the early hours of this morning, (Wednesday, 26 February) protestors closed off the road, at the turn off to Colenso from Pieters Road. During the protest, a truck that was heading to Ladysmith was stopped and set alight. In a matter of minutes, the truck was completely engulfed in flames. Ladysmith police were called to the scene and investigations are underway. It is believed that this is part of the total shut down of the Ladysmith CBD whereby a protest march is scheduled to take place later this morning. Meanwhile Uthukela District Municipality also received a notification from Umgeni Water reporting that the protesters have shut down the Ezakheni Plant, which will interfere with today’s water feed. The plant is currently not operational and as a result, this action will compromise water supply to the following areas; Ezakheni, Old Ladysmith, Steadville, Tsakane, St Chads, Danskraal and other areas fed from Ezakheni. This is the third call this month, for a total shut down in Ladysmith, as Umbubano Lothula and the Klipriver Taxi associations are calling for the Mayor of Alfred Duma Municipality to step down. This morning, protestors will be marching to the Ladysmith Town Hall and as a result public services will be affected. Taxi’s will not be operating in Ladysmith and the surrounding areas and many workers and school goers will have difficulty reaching their destination. This is a developing story and updates will follow as events unfold.
