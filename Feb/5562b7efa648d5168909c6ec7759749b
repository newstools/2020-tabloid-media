Police are making massive inroads into the drug trade in the province with a whopping R24 million recovery of mandrax tablets at a premises in Prospecton, in Isipingo Beach, on Wednesday, 5 February. Isipingo SAPS communications officer, Captain David Ragavan, confirmed the recovery and said, “At approximately 12.15pm, Captain Saunders of the Hawks together with Durban Metro Police recovered approximately half a ton worth of mandrax valued at approximately R24 million in street value at a premises on Avenue East in Prospecton, south of Durban. No arrests have been made and investigations are ongoing. Police are cracking down on the drug trade in Isipingo and this serves as an eye-opener to those who are dealing in narcotics to take note that they will be caught and brought to book,” Ragavan said.
