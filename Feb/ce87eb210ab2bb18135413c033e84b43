  A grade 11 pupil at Waterloo Secondary School appeared in the Verulam Magistrates Court today, 6 February, for allegedly stabbing another pupil. The court registrar said that the pupil was granted a warning and was requested to re-appear in court on 6 March. The school principal Mrs Mbatha ( the principal refused to provide a first name) said a meeting has been called later today with the parents of the pupils that were involved in an altercation that landed a Grade nine pupil in hospital. This comes after an 18-year-old pupil was allegedly stabbed at the high school in Waterloo on Wednesday, 5 February. Speaking to the Tabloid Newspapers, Mbatha said when the alleged incident happened she was not on the school premises, hence, she has scheduled a meeting with the parents of the pupils involved and the school teachers. According to the spokesperson of Reaction Unit South Africa (RUSA), Prem Balram, the Verulam Operations Centre received a call from a teacher at the school requesting assistance for the injured Grade nine pupil. “On arrival of the reaction officers, it was established that the Grade 11 pupil was assaulted with a wooden plank by five other pupils when he drew an okapi pocket knife and stabbed one of his attackers,” said Balram. “Teachers intervened and separated the fight before rushing the injured pupil to the nearest local clinic. The Grade 11 pupil was held in the staff room and handed over to the police,” he added. Verulam SAPS Captain Henry Kisten, confirmed that the suspect was detained and charged for civil and criminal offences and appeared in court today.
