Public Safety officers had to divert traffic this morning (Monday, 10 February) after parts of Lyell Street in Ladysmith CBD were found to be completely flooded due to the heavy down pours experienced the previous night. Those heading to work had to take off their shoes and cross large water puddles that had pushed up from the storm water drains. The Ladysmith Klipriver, situated along Settlers Drive could be seen pushing it banks. Officials at the Qudusizi dam wall, told Tabloid Newspapers, that the water level was sitting at 6.6m and slowly releasing water into the Klipriver. It is reported that more rain is predicted to fall later today. The Bellspriut situated along Shepstone Bridge was also flooded and it is said that a few motorists was stuck in the water. They were safely removed and no injuries were reported. Law enforcements officials have warned motorists to slow down, put their lights on and travel at safe following distances, as most road in and around the area is wet and slippery.
