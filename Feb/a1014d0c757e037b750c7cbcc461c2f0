After weeks of student unrest and damage to infrastructure at the University of KwaZulu-Natal’s campuses, the institution has been saddled with damages of about R30 million.   Buildings and furniture were either damaged or burnt by rioting students on campuses.   Some campuses were scenes of violence as the students continued protesting against paying historical debt of 15 percent owed to the university. The students were disgruntled by this as those owing could not register, leading to the protest. UKZN spokesperson Ashton Bodrick said that the university implored the perpetrators to stop. “Violence is not the solution to the challenges we are facing. This behaviour is only making matters worse.”  Nana Poku, vice-chancellor, said that it was hard for him to understand why the protests ensued as over 85 percent of the students were registered and are ready to study. He said that closing dates for registration were extended to 6 March.  Video footage went viral last week when Professor Ewing Brüning was show being assaulted on the Westville Campus. The assault was confirmed in a statement by the Poku saying that he was shocked.  “No fair minded person would ever find that acceptable,” said Poku. He added that the university condemned the violent act.  Brüning suffered slight injuries to his hand. , Police have said that no case was opened, though, according to a reliable source, investigations to the incident were continuing.  After the video went viral, author Kiru Naidoo made posted a reward anyone who can identify the perpetrators. “I am putting up R10 000 to help the university identify the perpetrator so that he could be charged and appropriately disciplined,” said Naidoo.  The university has assured that management was doing “everything possible” to resolve matters, put a stop to the violence and intimidation, and to ensure that there are no further interruptions to the academic programme.
