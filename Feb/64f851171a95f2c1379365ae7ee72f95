This week saw the recall of the 400g Pilchards in Tomato Sauce and Chilli Sauce widen to also include other brands. This comes after the National Regulator for Compulsory Specifications (NRCS) ordered that all formal wholesalers, retailers and informal traders remove and stop selling the products, following the outcome of an investigation conducted by the NRCS, which revealed a deficiency in the canning process. The affected products were manufactured in 2019 by Cape Town based West Point Processors and have been distributed nationally. West Point Processors issued a notice to its clients that “some products will be unfit for consumption due to a canning deficiency.” NRCS Food and Associated Industries general manager, Meisie Katz, said they are recalling all products packaged in June 2019. Katz explained that during the packaging of the affected products, they discovered that in the process of the sauce filling step, an incision took place, which makes the cans leak after some time. Katz added that there is no problem with the content, but the problem is with the packaging of the content.
 
“Some of the cans were compromised during the sauce filling step on the production line, therefore this could affect the safety of consumers. The problem manifests itself after months of storage, which causes the contents of the can to react with the metal of the can,” said Katz. Katz said the signs of the affected products show after three to six months from the packaging date. “Any can leaking can compromise the safety of consumers. We are recalling them. They should not be in the market,” said Katz. Consumers are urged to lookout for the following affected brands:
 
• Deep Catch 
• Mammas 
• OK Housebrand 
• Prime Ocean 
• Spar 
• Sunny 
• Shoprite Ritebrand 
• Cape Point 
• Checkers Housebrand 
• U-Brand 
• Saldanha 
• West Point Katz said that the manufacturer has already started the recall and the NRCS will continue to monitor the process with all wholesalers and retailers, including the informal market, to ensure that the process is handled efficiently. Consumers, who have purchased the products, are urged to check the code. If it starts with ZST2 9 or ZSC2 9, they must return it to the store where it was purchased, for a full refund.
