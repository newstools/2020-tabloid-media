President Cyril Ramaphosa in his fourth State of the Nation address on Thursday, said load shedding will continue for the next 18 months while South Africa grapples with renewable energy sources. Ramaphosa acknowledges that South Africa is facing a number of challenges and assured the nation that the issues such as the high unemployment rate and the university fees for students are being addressed.“Load shedding has had a serious effect on our economy and our people. Load shedding is the inevitable consequence of Eskom’s inability over many years due to debt, lack of capacity and state capture to service its power plants,” he said He said that over the next few months, as Eskom works to restore its operational capabilities, the government will be implementing measures that will “fundamentally change the trajectory of energy generation in our country”.This plan will include enabling the development of additional grid capacity from renewable energy, natural gas, hydropower, battery storage and coal. Speaking to Durban North News, acting ward 36 councillor Shontel de Boer said Ramaphosa made some moves in the right direction, but stopped far short of what was required. “Eskom remains the biggest threat to our nation, and the emergency measures announced on Thursday confirms that it is dead,” she said. “The ANC’s insistence on trying to resurrect the Eskom issues by (allegedly) raiding the pensions of government employees. There is no “financially sustainable” way to throw a quarter of a trillion rand of pension savings down a hole that has no bottom.While we welcome the announcement of plans to add additional energy to the grid, promises to process applications by commercial and industrial users to produce their own power within 120 days, as well as the decision to back the DA’s long-fought proposal to allow municipalities to procure their own power from independent producers, this is simply not enough,” added De Boer. She added that what Ramaphosa should have announced, was not only the breaking up of the utility into three separate entities, that of generation, transmission and distribution but also the privatisation of parts of it to settle its debt. He should have announced a rationalisation of its bloated workforce, and he should have vowed to keep his hands of the pension savings of hard-working South Africans, said De Boer.
