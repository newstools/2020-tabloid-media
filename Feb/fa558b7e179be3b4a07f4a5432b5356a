Estcourt and Ladysmith police are making an urgent appeal to trucking companies and their truck drivers, transporting goods along the N3 and N11 Freeways to stop only at allocated truck stops, after two incidents of robberies were reported this week. In both incidents, the drivers were held up at gunpoint and robbed of their personnel belongings whilst the tyres were stolen from the trucks. The first incident was reported along the Estcourt Midway, N3 off-ramp. The driver had pulled over onto the side of the road along the Estcourt Midway to take a break, when he was held up at gun point and robbed. The truck that he was driving had three of its tyres stolen and the driver’s personal belongings were taken. The second incident was reported along the N11, between Ladysmith and Newcastle. The driver was held up by armed men and four tyres were reported to be stolen as well as the drivers personal items. In both instances the driver’s were left unharmed.
