Medical students from UKZN took to the online world to promote a campaign aimed at settling a historical debt of R1 million through public donations, this week. They hope to escape financial exclusion through this short-term campaign, as student registration closes on 14 February. The Medical School Campus Representative Council’s (MCRC) student support officer, Xoliswa Njapha says that they are currently aware of 118 medical students who would be affected by the financial exclusion if students cannot settle the debt. “Students came up with the idea of fundraising as they could not watch their brother’s and sister’s dreams go to waste. Hence the call to all citizens for a contribution towards this cause. A cause to contribute towards the making of a doctor. That’s when the name of the campaign, #IMadeADoctor, was born”, said Njapha. According to Njapha, the idea did seem too ambitious and impossible as the campaign needed to raise the hefty amount in under two weeks. However, after receiving the thumbs up from the MCRC which boosted the confidence of the students, it was all systems go. Although the hashtag is yet to be featured in the trending corner of the Twittersphere, the campaign has received enormous support from social media users including Facebook and Instagram. Not reaching the targeted amount would mean that students with an historical debt would not be able to register for the academic year. This could perhaps cost a student, who has studied for six years already, their final year at medical school.
