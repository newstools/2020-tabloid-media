This is the third in a month for a total shut down of Ladysmith as the Umbubano Lothula Organisation and the Klipriver Taxi Association are calling for the mayor of the Alfred Duma Municipality, Vincent Madlala to step down.About 200 taxi operators and about 100 protestors marched on Murchison St today, (Wednesday, 26 February). Social media posts warned residents to stay at home and for children not to be sent to school. The march was led by the organisation’s Dr Andile Hlatshwayo who said that the people of Ladysmith have had enough. “The mayor must step down,” called Hlatshwayo. Businesses on Murchison St stayed closed and the usually busy main CBD street was deserted. The march ended at the Ladysmith Town Hall where a third memorandum was handed over to the Speaker Themba Ngubane after much debate about who the protestors wanted it to be given to.Protestors hurled insults at the city council in front of the Town Hall. At one stage organisers had to speak up as protestors refused to calm down and allow the contents of the memorandum to be read out. They demanded that the mayor come out and face them as they they said that they were tired of non-existent service delivery and alleged corruption. Protestors again alleged that the mayor is directly involved in the ongoing taxi feud.It was reported that the Umbubano Lothula Organisation will continue their onslaught against the municipality until their demands are met. The crowds dispersed peacefully and the CBD continued going about its business.Meanwhile, officials have warned motorists to stay clear of the CBD as taxis are closing off the CBD. Taxis continued to the main entrances blocking off all roads leading in and out of Ladysmith.     “Traffic in ladysmith is in chaos and in some places vehicles are unable to get out of town,” said a motorist.  Public safety officers and police are observing the situation. This is a developing story and updates will follow as events unfold.
