Love is in the air and there’s great excitement around Chatsworth with a number of residents preparing to attend the first Valentine’s social dance evening, at the Nelson Mandela Community Youth Centre.The social evening will take place on Saturday, 15 February, from 7pm. The event promises to be fun-filled with great music and good company.Jurie Thaver, a volunteer at the youth centre, said this could be an ideal night out for parents and friends or anyone wanting some time out from their responsibilities to let their hair down. She said it was the start of many more social dance evenings that will happen at least once a month.“We want to create a safe environment for people to have fun, learn how to dance or just practice moves they learned at dance classes. Lots of people want to spend a fun evening with family and friends, and just cannot seem to find a place for the older crowd to hang out at. Whatever your reason, we welcome you and want you to be a part of our social dance evenings,” Thaver added. Everyone is welcome to bring their picnic baskets, cooler boxes and dancing shoes. Partygoers can make a donation at the door to make the evening possible. For more information, call Clive Pillay on 061 429 2574 or Jurie Thaver on  079 693 6888.
