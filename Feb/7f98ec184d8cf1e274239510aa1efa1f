” You and I must regard our environment as a privilege and treat it with respect, ” said Democratic Alliance (DA) councillor Sharon Buys, who called upon the community of Ladysmith and its surrounding areas, to keep Ladysmith clean. Buys was conducting the first of many walkabouts in the Hilliard Oval Egerton area on Thursday morning, 6 February. She said, ” Our careless behaviour, wilful disrespect of ourselves,  selfishness and laziness, is unacceptable. Let us all get some self-respect and do the right thing. Do not litter,” added Buys. “The ‘Stinkspruit’/’Cochrane Spruit’/’George’s Gorge’ is a much talked about issue, with raw sewage and waste, including garden refuse being dumped, ” said Buys. Buys told the Ladysmith Herald that it is the community of Ladysmith who should also take responsibility in keeping Ladysmith clean. She said the district municipality and the local municipality are doing their best to alleviate the issue of dumping and litter but the residents are also part of the solution. She said that residents need to be educated that illegal dumping of any nature is unacceptable and she urged residents to work together in keeping Ladysmith clean.
