Every fourth year, an extra day in the calendar matches earthly time with cosmic time. This year, 29 February, is added to our calendar, creating a Leap Year. In a curious, centuries-old custom, ladies are traditionally given the opportunity to propose marriage or ask out men out for a date throughout the leap year. Some people find it awkward and others funny for a woman to propose love. Tabloid Newspaper took it to the streets to hear what people say about it. Mboniseni Bhane: I personally think it is a good idea.If you are attracted to someone, you should be free to open up to them about it. Let them know how you feel about them. We live in the 21st century and we are all equal thus the tasks of asking someone out, shouldn t be only for guys. If you want him go get him!Prashni Maharaja: Nowadays it doesn’t matter who asks who out, women are brave enough to shoot their shot. But I personally would never do that. I am a strong believer that a man should court the female because life is apparently easier if the man loves the women more.Phumelele Nxumalo: I actually think that the idea of women asking guys out for Valentine’s day is a good idea and I feel that its something that shouldn’t be done only when its leap year but that should be done on a yearly basis. I should be able to walk up to a guy should I feel that I like him. Tacita Meyer: I think it’s a good idea and a good fight towards breaking stereotypes and giving women a voice to express themselvesBradley Rumble: I think it’s a good idea because lots of woman nowadays wait for the men to ask the girls out so why not, there is no difference in that girls asking men out cause I feel if they like someone why not ask that person out before its to late where some one else too will ask that person out and you will get left, so why not. Mzwakhile Sithole: I think it’s a good idea because time waits for no one…and it’s good because if they ask you…it shows they are willing to pay.
