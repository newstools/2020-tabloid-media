Since the beginning of the year, the SAPS detectives have secured five life sentences as well as 89 years imprisonment for sexual offences at various courts in the province. In the past month investigators from the Family Violence, Child Protection and Sexual Offences Units (FCS) in KwaZulu-Natal arrested 354 suspects who were wanted for various crimes such as rape, sexual assault, attempted rape, kidnapping and assault with intent to cause grievous bodily harm. During the same period 12 of the accused were sentenced for crimes that they were alleged to have committed. Two of the accused were sentenced to life imprisonment for rape, whilst another three were sentenced to life imprisonment for rape and robbery. “These arrests as well as convictions are an indication that police are dealing with crimes against women and children effectively. We are appealing to the men in society to play a more meaningful role in protecting women and children as well as other vulnerable groups who are often viewed as weak and therefore subjected to abuse,” said the KZN provincial commissioner, Lieutenant General Khombinkosi Jula. “We are appealing to the men in society to play a more meaningful role in protecting women and children as well as other vulnerable groups, who are often viewed as weak and therefore, subjected to abuse,” Lt Gen Jula urged.
