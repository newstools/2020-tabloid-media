A teenage girl is fighting for her life following a serious collision on the M7 along Titren Road, Rossburgh, early this morning. Rescue Care paramedics arrived on the scene just after 6am to find carnage. Managing Director at Rescue Care, Garrith Jamieson, said, “A truck had T-boned a vehicle at the intersection. Immediately, more ambulances and Advanced Life Support paramedics were dispatched to assist. Paramedics found the teenager in a critical condition seated in the rear of the vehicle. After carefully extricating the patient, she was placed on a manual ventilator on the scene.” “Due to the severity of the teen’s injuries, the Lenmed 1 Aeromedical helicopter was called to rapidly transport her to the Lenmed eThekweni Hospital for the urgent care she required. Three other occupants from the same vehicle were stabilised on the scene before being transported to nearby hospitals for further care. The truck driver was not injured in the collision,” said Jamieson. He added that the events leading up to the crash are unknown and will be further investigated by SAPS and RTI who were on scene.
