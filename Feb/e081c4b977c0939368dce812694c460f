More than 200 taxis from the Ladysmith Klipriver Association, members of the Umbubabo Lokthula and the Economic Freedom Front (EFF) marched through the Ladysmith CBD peacefully this morning, Monday, 3 February, bringing the town to a standstill. The march which hit social networks on Thursday, 30 January called for a complete shut-down of Ladysmith. Workers and pupils were affected as taxis and buses failed to operate. Businesses in the CBD area closed their doors as the march continued down Murchison Street, bringing all traffic to a standstill. Led by Doctor Andile Hltatshwayo, this morning’s march ended at the Alfred Duma Municipality Town Hall where protestors demanded for the mayor to step down. In the memorandum handed over to the municipality, the credibility of the Alfred Duma Municipality, Councillor Vincent Madlala was raised. Allegations of corruption were levelled, including him being implicated in the taxi feud. On 14 January, a similar march was held, with protestors demanding that the mayor step down. A memorandum was handed over to Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs (Cogta), but according to reports, it was said that protocol was not followed and that the memorandum needed to be handed over to the council. This was what led to this morning’s march. In the wake of calls for a complete shut-down of Ladysmith and threats made, schools closed their doors and water services came to a halt. This is a developing story and updates will follow as events unfold.
