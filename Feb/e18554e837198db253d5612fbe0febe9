Students went on a rampage today, Monday 3 February,  at the University of KwaZulu-Natal (UKZN) Howard College and set fire to the office of the building of the HIV & AIDS Support Unit (CHASU) building. Fire and Emergency services were called to the scene. Two separate acts of arson were also
committed on the campus between last night and the early hours of Monday
morning. An office at the same HIV & AIDS Centre was set alight around 11pm
last night and an office at the Department of Student Residence Affairs was set
alight around 5am in the morning. University Risk Management Services (RMS)
immediately attended to and extinguished both fires. According to the
university spokesperson Ashok Bodrick, management and SAPS are investigating. He said, ”
The university strongly denounces all acts of criminal behavior. All incidents
of assault, destruction of property and arson are being investigated by
University’s Risk Management Services (RMS) and SAPS. Perpetrators will be
apprehended and handed over to SAPS for prosecution. ” He added that
security has been further bolstered and every effort is being made to ensure
that the Academic Programme proceeds as scheduled without any further
interruptions. Students incited violence following their
demands for their historical debt to be cancelled and that they should be
allowed to register at the university. Protesting students were on the rampage
since last week, with several students being arrested by police. Lectures were
scheduled to commence this morning at the university. The protests continued despite assurances
by the South African Union of Students (SAUS) at a meeting with the Minister of
Education, Science and Technology, Dr Blade Nzimande on Friday, 31 January,
that the national students strike would be called off. This is a developing story and updates
will follow as events unfold.
