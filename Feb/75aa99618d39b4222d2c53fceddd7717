The sweltering heat forced a boomslang, a highly venomous snake, to cool off at a beach in Winkelspruit on the South Coast last week. A policeman who saw the snake swimming close to the shore, took a picture and called snake expert, Nick Evans, for assistance. According to Evans, the 1,5 metre boomslang was disorientated and exhausted. “After catching the snake I released it into the bush.Boomslangs are highly venomous. They won’t harm anyone if left alone. However if someone tries to catch or kill the snake, then that is another story. People take their dogs for a walk on the beach. Children play there too. It is not ideal to have a boomslang on the beach,” said Evans.
