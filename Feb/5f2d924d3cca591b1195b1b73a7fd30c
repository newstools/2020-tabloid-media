A 23-year-old male was arrested for perjury by Durban Central detectives on Thursday, 27 February, after he had filed a false case of carjacking the previous day (Wednesday, 26 February) at the Durban Central police station. It is alleged that the suspect had reported that his car had been hijacked, however, the police official who interviewed him found discrepancies in his complaint. “The police official became suspicious of the report and an initial investigation commenced. The reported car was later found parked at the Berea police station. It is alleged that the motor vehicle arrived at the police station after the driver  was arrested for drunk driving the previous night. It was also alleged that the complainant was in the car as a passenger when the driver who was his friend was arrested, ” said Durban Central spokesperson, Captain Muzi Maphumulo. Captain Maphumulo added that both the driver and complainant were drunk and the owner of the car had realised the following day (Wednesday) that he did not know where his car was and then decided to report it as hijacked. According to the SAPS, in South Africa, perjury is considered to be a common law crime which consists of the unlawful and intentional making of a false statement in the course of a judicial proceeding by a person who has taken the oath or made an affirmation before, or who has been admonished by somebody competent to administer or accept the oath, affirmation or admonition. The offence is punishable with a maximum sentence of three years imprisonment with an option of a fine payment, unlike a statutory offence. “We want to inform the public that if a statement is made under oath and a lie is told, then that constitutes a crime. Police use resources for cases which are sometimes false. We appeal to the public to work with the police in solving crime and to not be part of a criminal team,” said Maphumulo. The arrested person, who is charged for perjury, is expected to appear in court today.
