In celebration of World Read Aloud Day (WRAD) on 5 February, St Benedict School Grade 1 and 2 pupils took some time out from class to read aloud in the school garden. According to National reading NGO Nali’ bali, the fire of literacy is created by the emotional sparks between a child, a book and the person reading.Nali’ bali’s marketing director Jade Jacobsohn said: “The reading out loud of a story, not only shows children the value of books but starts discussions, builds bonds between the reader and the audience and motivates children to learn to read and enjoy books beyond their current reading ability.” says Jacobsohn.
