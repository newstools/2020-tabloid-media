Former first lady, Graça Machel, has been introduced as one of the speakers at the Forbes Woman Africa Leading Women’s Summit at the ICC in Durban on 6 March. Former president Nelson Mandela’s wife has continued the work of her iconic late husband, as chairperson of the Nelson Mandela Children’s Hospital Trust and serves as a trustee of the Nelson Mandela Children’s Fund.   Machel’s connection with Africa’s freedom struggles is deep rooted. She has been in the forefront of advancing women’s and children’s rights for decades. Renuka Methil, managing editor of Forbes Woman Africa, said the calibre of the  participants has attracted global attention. ” We are excited to welcome the game-changers to the 2020 programme. Their embodiment of this year’s theme, ‘The Ceiling Crashers 2020: Power with Purpose,’ will showcase their quest to level the playing fields. They have proven their worth in the country, Africa and globally,” said Renuka Methil. The attendees will benefit from Machel’s continental insight into breaking age-old gender barriers as well as her role in promoting inclusivity across a number of key sectors.
