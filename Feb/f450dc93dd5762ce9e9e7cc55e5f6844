Acaciavale Primary School had to shut their doors and turn away school pupils for the second time this week, after the Jantha Road transformer blew in the early hours of this morning (7 February). The school which had no water and electricity began sending pupils home as they arrived this morning. This is the also second time this week that parts of Ladysmith are left in the dark and without water. Earlier in the week, residents were without electricity and water for more than 24 hours when the transformer was struck by lighting on Monday afternoon (3 February). Since then Alfred Duma municipality engineers and electrical technicians have been working tirelessly to fix the transformer and restore water and electricity to the affected areas.The Municipality said that crews are still working on the problem and they can’t say at this stage what had caused the transformer to blow. According to the municipality, they are doing everything they can to resolve the problem and will provide a detailed report later today. This is a developing story and updates will follow as events unfold.
