Horrified and furious locals who caught a man in the act of raping a three-year-old toddler girl in the nearby bushes spurred residents to mete out mob justice resulting in the suspect’s death, in Emalengeni in the South Coast, recently. Scottburgh SAPS communications officer, Captain Adam Francis, said, “It is alleged by the complainant that she was babysitting her two nieces on 8 February when she was disturbed by an intruder in the bedroom at Phase 2 in Emalengeni. A fight broke out between them and she was able to escape to her neighbours. The suspect then grabbed her three-year-old niece and fled into the bushes.Neighbours came to her rescue and the suspect was caught red handed raping the victim in the nearby bushes. The suspect was arrested by the community members and he succumbed to his injuries at the Umzinto Clinic. A case of rape and murder has been registered.”
