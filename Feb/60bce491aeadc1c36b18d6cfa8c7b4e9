A 22 year-old Ntabamhlophe gun man was traced and arrested in Newcastle on Wednesday, 5 February. According to Ntabamhlophe Police, the man was hiding out, after he shot and killed his friend in Estcourt on 24 January. Detectives made a breakthrough and immediately travelled to Newcastle to make the arrest. It is reported that on 24 January, two friends decided to take a trip to Lower Shayamoya in Ntabamhlophe near Estcourt travelling in a vehicle full of goats when gunshots were heard emanating from the vehicle. 40-year-old Nhlanhla Hlela was heard screaming for help and was found bleeding on the upper part of his body. He was privately transported to the hospital, after bystanders come to his rescue. 
 
The police received a report of the shooting and proceeded to the hospital where Hlela informed them that while they were travelling in their vehicle with his 22-year-old friend, an argument broke out and the friend shot him before fleeing the scene on foot. Hlela later succumbed to his injuries in hospital. A case of murder was opened at Ntabamhlope police station for investigation. The suspect left the area when he heard that his friend had died and the police were looking for him. The goats were suspected to be stolen from Ladysmith and surroundings areas.
 
The 22 year-old man was charged with murder and is set to appear at the Estcourt Magistrates Court.  Detectives are confident that the suspect will be linked to other cases.
 
The KwaZulu-Natal Provincial Commissioner, Lieutenant General Khombinkosi Jula commended Ntabamhlophe detectives for their perseverance in bringing the suspect to book.
