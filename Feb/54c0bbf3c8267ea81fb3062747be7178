Wouldn’t it amazing to watch the late, great, talented Robin Williams on the big screen (12m by 9m) once again? Well, you can while supporting an excellent cause, because The Association for the Aged’s movie night fundraiser is showing Jumanji, the 1995 classic starring Williams at their signature Old School Drive-Inn movie night event at the Durban Country Club on 6 March 2020 between 6 and 10pm! For just R220 a car, or R100 a picnic spot (bring your own chair), you and your family can enjoy an evening under the night skies, whilst following the thrilling adventures of Williams and his game mates as they tackle the Jumanji challenge. Also on offer are a variety of food and drinks vendors, or you can bring along your own picnic to enjoy on the lawns of the Durban Country Club driving range. The popular fundraising event, now going into its second year, is a great opportunity for Tafta to raise funds whilst providing an opportunity for family bonding time across the ages. “In fact, we’ve themed 2020 a year of collaboration across generations at Tafta and we intend to embrace this theme through as many exciting public platforms as we can. Those coming along as family are encouraged to bring along an older person too and even enter our intergenerational Selfie Challenge to stand in line to win an amazing prize!” said Tafta CEO Femada Shamam. The next movie night will raise funds towards Tafta’s Needy pensioner’s scheme, which supports the organisation’s elders with basic necessities for daily living.
