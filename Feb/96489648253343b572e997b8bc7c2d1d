Two nurses have been suspended at St Mary’s Hospital, in Marianhill, for allegedly failing to assist a woman in labour. The woman gave birth to a premature baby on Friday, 14 February. The baby passed away eight hours after it was born. It was alleged that the woman was assisted by other patients in the ward to deliver the baby after she had pleaded with the nurses to assist her. Her pleas were ignored and she was allegedly told by the nurses to let them know once the baby starts crying. The nurses have been placed on special leave since Sunday, 16 February. The KwaZulu-Natal (KZN) Department of Health has since confirmed that both nurses have been suspended, pending a formal investigation. KZN Health MEC, Nomagugu Simelane-Zulu, has welcomed the suspension. Simelane-Zulu said there is no space in the department for people who want to involve themselves in any kind of misconduct, which disrespects patients who come to their facilities in desperate need of help. She said: “It is the job of healthcare professionals to provide care, support, and overall nursing so that these people, who come to us because they have nowhere to go, can overcome whatever ailment they are suffering from.” In January this year, nurses at a Nongoma clinic were placed on suspension for turning away a woman in labour. The young mother gave birth in a taxi en route to the hospital. Simelane-Zulu said: “What is alleged to have happened goes against everything that this administration stands for, which is respect for patients and the prioritisation of their needs. Therefore, we expect the accounting officer to investigate and take the necessary disciplinary action when such things happen.”
