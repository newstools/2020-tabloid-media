Night vigils and shooting in the air have come under the spotlight and the South African Police Service of the eThekwini Outer South Cluster (EOS) has issued an urgent warning to the public after a man was killed in uMlazi, recently.“We want to warn the public about shooting in the air, especially during night vigils. Bullets fired into the air fall back on the ground and unfortunately innocent people can be injured, sometimes fatally.This was the case at E Section in uMlazi when a 25-year-old male victim lost his life during a night vigil,” said EOS communications officer, Captain Carmen Rhynes. “Shooting into the air is very dangerous. It is important to remember that unlawful discharge of a firearm in a public place, is a serious offence, which will have you arrested and your firearm license removed,” she added.“We appeal to the community to be aware of those who have unlicensed firearms and immediately phone CrimeStop on 08600 10 111 to give information on these unlicensed firearms. SAPS would like to remove all unlicensed firearms within our communities. If we can remove unlicensed firearms from our communities, we will certainly be creating a safer South Africa for all. There will be far less serious crime, such as murder, carjacking, business robbery, house robbery and rape committed,” Rhynes said. I appeal to the community to work hand in hand with the police to remove illegal firearms. We can certainly make a difference, if we work together.
