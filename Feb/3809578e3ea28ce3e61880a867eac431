He said: “I have yet to see or speak to her myself, but we are relieved that she is alive and in good health.”Mahomed was last seen by her family on 12 February, at around 6.30 am. Sheik said the pensioner left home carrying three packets and her handbag after indicating that she intended to move to a shelter, following a family dispute. A missing person alert was then circulated by private security company, Reaction Unit South Africa (Rusa). Prem Balram, Rusa spokesperson, said: “Her family made repeated attempts to call her throughout the day but she refused to answer their calls. Her mobile phone was turned off at 3.55 on the same day.” Sheik said Mahomed has yet to reach out to them. “We are giving her the space that she requires, we are just glad that she has been located and is still taking care of herself” he said.
