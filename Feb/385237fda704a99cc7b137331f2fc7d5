The search for a missing 36-year-old Greenpoint man is currently underway in Bergville, west of KwaZulu-Natal. Members of the K9 Search and Rescue Unit from Newcastle, Pietermaritzburg and Ladysmith, lead by Warrant OfficerJacques Meyer spent hours trudging through rough watery terrains in search of the 36 year-old, who is presumed to have been washed away by the Ngconconsi River in the Bergville area. The search started on Tuesday, 11 February, after members of the community contacted the Bergville police, reporting that the man was last seen trying to cross the river when he was swept away. The Greenpoint man is alleged to have been on horse back, when the incident occurred. Since the search started, Bergville SAPS and members of the community walked over 8km along the river bank, in search of the man. The K9 Search and Rescue officials, along with their K9 colleagues searched the river. The search entered its third day with no new findings. The search continues.
