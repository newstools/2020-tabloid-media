A man accused of stabbing a LGBTQI gender activist to death at a butcher shop in uMlazi recently appeared in the uMlazi Magistrate’s Court last week. The accused was remanded in custody. The family of the slain Lindokuhle Cele believes the tragedy is a hate crime. Cele (23) was a well-known lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer and intersex (LGBTI) activist and musician. His aunt, Nombuso Cele, claimed that the accused hated Cele because he was gay.”Nombuso was waiting in the queue to buy meat. The accused jumped out of a taxi and stabbed him multiple times. Nombuso begged for his life to be spared but the killer showed no mercy. My nephew died at Prince Mshiyeni Memorial Hospital,” said Cele;. Anthony Waldhausen, director of the Gay and Lesbian Network, said there was an increase in hate crimes against gays and lesbians in the country. “We are very concerned about this. Even though we have a Constitution that protects everyone, we are still having murders, fights and discrimination. The public must accept people for who they are, Being gay and lesbian is normal. People need to understand that,” said Waldhausen.
