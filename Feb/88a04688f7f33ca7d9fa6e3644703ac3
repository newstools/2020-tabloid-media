Disaster management teams are on high alert as heavy downpours are expected to continue in eThekwini. According to the South African Weather Service (SAWS), rains which began yesterday,  are expected to hit the city the entire day. To-date, between 60 to 70 mm of rain have been recorded, a recipe for localised flooding. The wet weather is expected to clear tomorrow, however, with 30 percent chances of downpours in the afternoon. EThekwini Mayor, Councillor Mxolisi Kaunda said: “The situation warrants that our disaster management teams must respond with speed in the event their services are required. We are calling upon the public to work with us by heeding our warnings. Everyone should be mindful that we are a city that is prone to disasters largely caused by heavy rains. We would only minimise negative impact of disasters when we work together. The public must not hesitate to call our call centre in the event they need our help. Their welfare comes first and we shall not put their lives at risk.” Motorists are urged to drive with caution as roads are extremely slippery. Where traffic lights are not working, they should bear in mind that orders of officers of the law, reign supreme in such circumstances. Residents in flood susceptible areas, are called upon to be ultra-cautious. In the event of disaster, the public can call 031 361 0000.
