On Tuesday, eight suspects were arrested and appeared in court for obstructing police officers when they attempted to halt the demolition of an illegal shelter which some residents believe is an alleged drug den on Lansdowne Road in Wentworth. Police spokesperson, Brigadier Jay Naicker, said, “A group of residents met with their councillor and demanded that a shelter that was illegally erected by drug peddlers on Lansdowne Road in Wentworth be dismantled. Residents were concerned as they claimed that the structure was being used as a drug den. Their concerns stem from another suspected drug related shooting that occurred on 3 February 2020 at 22:30 in which a 40-year-old woman was shot and wounded on Lansdowne Road.” “Once it was confirmed that the structure was erected illegally, police were requested to assist with security during the demolition of the structure. Police officers from Wentworth SAPS and Public Order Police who responded were confronted by a group of people who were opposed to the illegal structure being demolished. They were informed to disperse by police, however, they refused to comply and obstructed the police officers from executing their duties. A total of eight suspects aged between 17 and 56 were arrested for obstructing police officers. The illegal structure was later dismantled by residents. The area remains calm and police are monitoring the situation,” said Naicker. “These arrests will serve as warning to others in the Wentworth community who are wreaking havoc as they pursue their trade in drugs. Operations are on-going and we remain committed to work with community leaders and law-abiding citizens to break this vicious cycle of criminality that is plaguing the community at Wentworth,” said the KwaZulu-Natal Provincial Commissioner, Lieutenant General Khombinkosi Jula.
