Disaster Management teams have been placed on high alert across KZN by the Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs MEC, Sipho Hlomuka, following a weather warning from the South African Weather Service, indicating severe thunderstorms is expected over the western parts of the province this afternoon (7 February), with possible heavy downpours, hail and strong winds. It is predicted that parts of the Zululand, uMzinyathi, Amajuba, Harry Gwala and uMgungundlovu districts will be affected. Hlomuka has urged residents to take the necessary precautions, as hail poses a serious risk to human life, property and livestock. “Our disaster management teams are monitoring areas that are prone to such incidents so that they respond faster should the need arise,” said Hlomuka. Hlomuka urged residents to report any incidents to their nearest District Disaster Management Centre or to their local councillors. Heavy down pours have been reported in Ladysmith and surrounding areas, since yesterday evening, 6 February. Motorists have been asked by law enforcement officials when travelling on national and local roads to adhere to the rules of the road as wet weather conditions have made the roads slippery. Motorists have also been warned to keep a safe following distance and to watch their speed.
