After nine months of intensive investigation by SAPS detectives, assigned to the case a suspect linked to a triple murder in KwaNdengezi has been arrested and will be appearing in the Pinetown Magistrates court, on 13 February. A 28-year-old suspect was arrested on Monday night (10 February), at Isipingo at his place of employment where he works as a security guard. His arrest follows an incident that took place on 5 April 2019, at Shongweni where three male relatives, all in their late twenties, were asleep in an outbuilding when their dwelling caught on fire. The three victims, Thabo Maphumulo, Sboniso and Siyabonga Shabalala were burnt beyond recognition when their home was doused with petrol and set alight. Initially an inquest was opened at KwaNdengezi SAPS. Following a rigorous probe, the investigating officer was able to connect the dots with regards to the suspect involved and the docket was changed to murder. On Monday night, the suspect was traced and arrested with the assistance of the K9 Unit. The investigation revealed that the deceased and suspect are related. The KwaZulu-Natal provincial Commissioner, Lieutenant General Khombinkosi Jula commended the investigating officer for his perseverance in investigating the case. “These arrests send a clear message to the perpetrators of crime that the long arm of the law will always catch up with you. We hope this arrest will bring closure to the family,” he said.
