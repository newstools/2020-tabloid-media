Three men accused of killing a teacher and her assistant were sentenced by the Durban High Court on Tuesday, 11 February. Kgotso Falang Ntilane (20) was sentenced to two terms of life imprisonment for murder and 15 years imprisonment for robbery. His co-accused Nkanyiso Mvuna (20) and Ndumiso Myeni (20) were each sentenced to 15 years imprisonment for robbery for the role they played in the case. It is alleged that on 7 November 2018, at 09.55am, the bodies of Nonhlanhla Zondi (54) and her assistant, Slindile Buthelezi (36) were found at a sugarcane field near Table Mountain Road in Bishopstowe. The victims were taken from their home in Appelsbosch where they were robbed of a vehicle and their valuables before being strangled to death. A case of murder was opened at the Bishopstowe police station for further investigation. Following an investigation that was conducted, police proceeded to Alexandra in Gauteng where the deceased’s vehicle was recovered. The accused who were found in possession of valuables belonging to the deceased were immediately arrested and charged for possession of suspected stolen property. The men were brought to the province to face the consequences for their actions. They were tried in court and remained in custody until their sentence. The investigation revealed that Ntini was related to the deceased and he orchestrated the murder. “It is very disturbing to learn that the person who committed such evil acts was related to the victims. The sterling investigation conducted by the investigative team is commended,” said the KwaZulu-Natal Provincial Commissioner, Lieutenant General Khombinkosi Jula.
