The University of KwaZulu-Natal has suspended the academic programmes at all the campuses from today (10 February), until further notice. The suspension applies to all UKZN campuses and its colleges. This comes in the wake of student protests over the past two weeks that saw students protesting over the payment of historical debt. Students burnt buildings and clashed with police at all campuses. UKZN spokesperson Ashton Bodrick said that the cancellation of the classes began today from 07h45 until further notice. The date of the re-commencement of the academic programme will be issued in due course, both via an official Registrar Communique and on the University website,” said Bodrick. Bodrick said that registration for both undergraduate and postgraduate students will continue unabated. He urged all students to conclude with their registration as soon as possible. The Student Representative Council (SRC) president Sifiso Simelane said, ” We told the management that they must try to find solutions. The only thing they did was to serve us with a court interdict – all 44 members including the executive. This is is nothing but a delay tactic. “ Simelane said that suspending academic programmes is not going to resolve issues like the financial clearance and better accommodation. ” We are against the suspension of academic programmes and we believe that we should deal with these issues so that we can be able to move with the academic program, ” said Simelane. Bodrick has confirmed that a meeting between management and SRC will take place on Tuesday (11 February) to continue discussions,” said Bodrick. This is a developing story and updates will follow as events unfold.
