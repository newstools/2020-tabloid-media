A young woman is fighting for her life in hospital after ruthless suspects robbed and stabbed her multiple times during a car breakdown on Tara Road, on the Bluff, last week. Police spokesperson, Colonel Thembeka Mbele said: “A case of assault with the purpose to inflict grievous bodily harm is investigated by Brighton Beach SAPS. It is alleged the victim was stabbed by two suspects while on Tara Road. She sustained stab wounds to the body. Her handbag and cellphone were taken. The matter is still under investigation.” Reports of the incident were posted on social media community crime awareness groups where it was stated that “a young lady had car trouble on the Bluff.” The victim is alleged to be in her 20’s. The post further read that various respondents attended the scene. One person reported that it was initially believed to have been a hijacking and a search for the vehicle commenced via the tracking company. The vehicle was found behind the local Pigeon Club and was stained with blood. The victim is reported to have sustained cuts to her arms and stomach and was rushed to a private hospital where she is in the intensive care unit. Women have been cautioned to refrain from driving alone late at night and to notify a family member when travelling.
