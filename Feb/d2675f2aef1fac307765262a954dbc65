The KwaZulu-Natal Legislature as part of its constitutional mandate namely: Law making, Oversight over the Executive Council and Enhancement of Public Participation, on Friday had an engagement session with traditional leaders, traditional healers, social development reps, mayors, ward councillors, NGOs, faith-based institutions, The Commission for Gender Equality, the SAPS and the National Prosecuting Authority, said Super Zuma. Zuma is the senior spokesperson in the KZN legislature. “Top of the list, is the scourge of albino killings for muthi and trafficking of human body parts. Umhlabuyalingana has been identified as a playground for violent and cross-border crimes since it is situated near the border that separates South Africa and Mozambique.The committee noted a “surge” in violent crimes against South Africans living with albinism, including the grisly murder of a 20-year-old woman for muthi at Scabazini, Umhlabuyalingana. The Vryheid Regional Court found two 19-year-old men guilty of murdering the woman and burying her mutilated body in a shallow grave, and the senseless murder of three young boys by their former teacher who has admitted to killing them and is due to appear in court on 12 March.”He said The committee read with heavy heart also the incident on 7 February , where an 85-year-old woman was brutally raped and died later in hospital. “The perpetrator, a 20-year-old man, also died a cruel death when he suffered instant justice at the hands of an angry mob. In the belief that albino body parts have extraordinary powers, unscrupulous dealers have resorted to harvesting their body parts with the expectation that these will help them become rich. It is reported that they have created a black market, that runs on Wednesdays and Saturdays, wherein they sell and exchange illegally obtained items including human body parts,” said Zuma
