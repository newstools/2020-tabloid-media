Paramedics arrived at the scene to find the badly damaged vehicles in the roadway.  “The vehicles had collided head-on. One driver a female in her 50’s was severely entrapped in a critical condition. While Advanced Life Support paramedics worked to stabilise her in the vehicle the Durban Fire Department used the Jaws of Life to cut the lady free. Once freed the patient was carefully extricated,” said Jamieson.He said the patient had sustained multiple critical injuries and was placed on a manual ventilator, at the scene before being rushed to the Lenmed Ethekweni Hospital. However, due to the severity of her injuries, the woman passed away a short while later. “Two occupants from the second vehicle had sustained moderate injuries and were stabilised on the scene before being transported to hospital. The event leading up to the crash is unknown, however, SAPS were on scene investigating further,” Jamieson added.
