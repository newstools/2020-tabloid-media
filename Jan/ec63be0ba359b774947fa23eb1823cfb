As the Al-Imdad Foundation’s Vision-4-Life cataract surgery programme, for people throughout Northern KZN, continued at the Dundee hospital, the Department of Health hosted a quality awards ceremony recently to honour the Foundation for their contribution to the local health sector. Honoured too were Turkish ophthalmic surgeon, Dr Mehmet Aslan and his technical assistant, Sertaç Yildiz, from the Alliance of International Doctors. They were given certificates of appreciation and excellence for their contribution to alleviate problematic cataracts in patients who couldn’t afford the surgery or don’t have a medical aid. Al-Imdad’s project co-ordinator, Abed Karrim, confirmed that “hundreds” of cataract surgeries were already been performed in KZN. Among the local patients was a Mr Seedat, who said that this surgery was “genuinely a gift from God. Overall, I am so pleased with the manner in which the procedure was carried out. The doctor and his assistant were too good and the nurses were brilliant! They were so helpful and friendly,” he said. Another patient, Mrs Hargovan, praised the Al-Imdad Foundation, the Dundee hospital and the surgeon and his assistant. “May God bless all these people, who have made so many people’s lives much easier. The whole experience was so pleasant and I am truly grateful”. Karrim, accepted the award on behalf of the Al-Imdad Foundation – a non-profit humanitarian aid relief organisation dedicated to providing humanitarian services in crisis and non-crisis situations to orphans, widows and the destitute, irrespective of race, religion, culture, creed and geographical location. Al-Imdad’s cheif executive Yacoob Vahed, thanked the Dundee hospital, health officials and the Alliance of International doctors for making this opportunity possible. He said that they were pleased to have been able to assist with the current backlogs of patients awaiting surgeries at public facilities.
