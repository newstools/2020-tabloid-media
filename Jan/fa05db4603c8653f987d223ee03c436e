Relatives and friends of a  woman who was beaten up and fatally shot on New Year’s Eve, staged a placard demonstration  at the Umbumbulu Magistrate’s Court and asked that the accused, a Durban Metro policeman, be denied bail.The magistrate ordered that the alleged killer, Ndumiso Khumalo, be held in custody at Westville Prison. Khumalo, charged for the murder of his ex girlfriend, Zinhle Muthwa, exited the dock quickly. The state alleged that Khumalo fetched Muthwa from her New Germany home on New Year’s Eve and dumped her body on a road near the Ndaya Reserve in Umbumbulu.  Apart from being shot in the head, the deceased sustained  head injuries and bruises all over the body. Provincial police spokesperson, Captain Nqobile Gwala, said Khumalo was arrested on 4 January in Umbumbulu. eThekwini Municipality Mayor Mxolisi Kaunda has condemned the murder. “The municipality strongly condemns gender  based violence. It  is sad that Muthwa was allegedly  killed by someone who was meant to uphold the law. I appeal to  Durban Metro Police members not to use state issued guns to deal with anger issues,” said Kaunda.
