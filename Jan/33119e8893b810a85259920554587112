Two men who wanted to hijack a man last month at the corner of South Coast Road and Himalaya Drive are behind bars – thanks to the car’s dash cam which captured them pointing a firearm at the motorist and excellent police investigations. The men were caught just weeks after the video of the crime went viral on social media posts. Provincial police spokesperson, Captain Nqobile Gwala said the two suspects, aged 20 and 33, were arrested by the eThekwini Inner South Cluster Task Team and Montclair SAPS.  According to Gwala, a 45-year-old male was with his family when the hijackers pounced. “The motorist and his family were ordered to get out the car. The complainant however  managed to reverse and drove off,” said Gwala. Gwala said an intelligence driven operation was conducted which led to the arrest of a 20-year-old suspect who was in possession of a firearm and a 33-year-old suspect.  “They were arrested in Lamontville and charged for attempted hijacking. Further investigations revealed that the  33-year-old suspect was linked to a hijacking in Montclair on November 22,” said Gwala. The KwaZulu-Natal Provincial Commissioner, Lieutenant General Khombinkosi Jula commended the police officers for their superb investigations.
