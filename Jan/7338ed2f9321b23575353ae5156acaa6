Social
media was abuzz this morning, warning of a complete shutdown of Ladysmith on
Monday 3 February. The
Umbubano Lokthula and the Klipriver Taxi Association have called for a peaceful
march in the town, from 9am to 12pm. Ladysmith police have confirmed the march.
There is also a call for the Alfred Duma Municipality mayor Vincent Madlala to
step down. Social
media posts warned residents to stay home and for children not to be sent to
school. Posts said that anyone interested in joining the march will get a free
taxi ride to the Town Hall. In recent
months Ladysmith has been dogged by continued taxi violence between rival
organisations baying for lucrative routes, with high ranking members and taxi owners
being gunned down in public. Police
have since maintained a very strong presence at the extremely busy taxi rank in
the Ladysmith CBD. A
peaceful march was hosted at the beginning of the year with more than 200 taxis
and members of Umbubano Lokthula, lead by Dr Andile Hlatshwayo, hosted a
peaceful march. Hlatshwayo
handed a detailed memorandum to a representative of the KwaZulu-Natal Corporate
Governance and Traditional Affairs (Cogta), where they demanded the various
allegations be investigated and that mayor must step down. At the
time of going to press, no comment was available from the municipality.
