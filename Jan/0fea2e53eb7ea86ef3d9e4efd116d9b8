The kidnapping trial of the four accused in the Sandra Munsamy case has been hit with more delays. The four accused, two South Africans and two Mozambican nationals, appeared at the Durban Magistrate’s Court on Monday only for the case to be postponed to 28 January. This after the defense lawyer for the SA accused, Mxolisi Nxasana, brought up an issue with them being moved to a maximum security prison in Kokstad, “without consultation” with their lawyer. Nxasana, the former head of the National Prosecuting Authority, told the court that the accused being put in Kostad makes it difficult for consultation, due to the distance. He made an application to the court to be furnished with reasons as to why the accused were moved to Kokstad.Another delay in the case was caused by the state, requesting more time from the court. State prosecutor, Kuveshnie Pillay, told the court that they were still awaiting cellphones record and the outcome of DNA results, sent to Pretoria for analysis.The case was then postponed to next Tuesday, for the court to hear why the four accused have been moved to a maximum security prison in Kokstad. The businesswoman’s alleged abductor face charges of kidnapping, extortion and attempted murder. Munsamy, who was held in captivity for 162, was found in November 2019 chained, at a house in Emalahleni in the Mpumalanga province. According to reports her alleged kidnappers were demanding a R140 million ransom from her family, who own the embattled Xmoor Transport CC, located in Chatsworth.
