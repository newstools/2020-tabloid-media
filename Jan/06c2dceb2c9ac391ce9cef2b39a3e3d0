Westville Non-Profit Organisation (NPO), Robin Hood Foundation (RHF) has partnered with Lotus FM for their annual Back to School 2020 Campaign. Chairlady Cindy Norcott said that she is hoping to reach out to over 1000 children with new backpacks filled with stationery essentials this year. The first of RHFs projects from this drive will be hosted at Golden Gateway School for about special needs children on Thursday, 30 January at 10.30am. Kim Griffith Jones, co-ordinator of the foundation said that they have worked with the school previously for RHF’s Christmas 4Kids and this year wanted to change things a bit as they are celebrating 15 years of serving the community. “Our chairlady’s vision was to start the year by equipping as many children as we can, especially for their educational year ahead. These children definitely hold a place in our hearts,” said Jones She said that each year the foundation communicates with the school to find out where they need help and stationary is always on top of the list This year the programme will include volunteer interaction, play, delicious lunch and then a hand over of jam-packed back packs to the scholars for their term ahead. RHF thanks its generous supporters who donated towards this worthy cause.
