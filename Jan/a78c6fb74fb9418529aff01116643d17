Durban North snake expert, Jason Arnold warns the public to be cautious around snakes during snake season and load shedding. Arnold said this after an incident that occurred in Newlands West when he was called to remove a 2.2 metre long Black mamba last Wednesday night. He said that he was called by a panicking home owner just after 8.30pm. “The resident saw the Black Mamba moving under his sofa and was on the phone to me when the load shedding occurred. When I arrived I used a torch and a headlamp and found the snake coiled under the sofa in the living room.” Anold said when people do find themselves in such situations the first thing they should do is to get to a safe place. “If it means you get out of the house, so be it,” said Arnold. He cautioned people to not ask for help from their neighbours or friends but should call a professional expert to remove the snake. “Calling a friend or a neighbour can make the situation worse because they are not trained to remove snakes. Snakes can get easily aggravated and if there is no expert around, people can be bitten by the snake which can lead to deaths,” he said. He further said that people need to be aware that there is nothing that cures snake bites except an anti-venom. “As soon as you are bitten by a snake, immediately go to your nearest healthcare centre. “Do not use home remedies or try sucking out the snake venom because it can deteriorate to an even worser condition,” he said. He said that Summer is a snake season and it is important to always be on the look-out. For snake removals contact Jason Arnold on 082 745 6375.
