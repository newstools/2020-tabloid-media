A house robbery suspect was killed in a shootout during a high speed chase on the N2 near Sibaya a short while ago (Friday). Reaction Unit South Africa (RUSA) received a call from Tracker requesting assistance in stopping a Toyota Rav that was taken during a home invasion in Stanger. The vehicle was travelling South on the N2 and was being pursued by several law enforcement agencies. During the chase the suspects opened fire on first responders who returned fire at the getaway vehicle. The suspects rammed into a pursuing Toyota Hilux bakkie and a VW Amarok. The gunmen lost control of their vehicle which veered off the highway and crashed into a tree in the center median. The robbers continued firing as they crossed the north bound lane on foot. One suspect was shot and killed while his accomplice fled into a bush adjacent to the highway. A 9mm pistol with an extended magazine was found next to the deceased. The RUSA Robinson R44 helicopter was called out and conducted an aerial search of the area however the remaining suspect is still at large. A first responder suffered minor injuries after a bullet travelled through the door of his Toyota Hilux bakkie and struck him on his side. The bakkie was shot multiple times during the chase. Members of Reaction Unit South Africa, IPSS, SAPS, RTI and Tracker are currently searching the area for the remaining suspect.
