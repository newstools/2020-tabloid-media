The Durban and Coast Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (SPCA) has called for donations to feed stray pets which have significantly increased during the festive season. SPCA’s Tanya Fleischer said that the reason behind the increase of stray cats, kittens, puppies and dogs during the festive season is that animals are more active during summer, so the members of the public are unlikely to notice because they are occupied by festivities. “Some pet owners go away on holiday without providing care for their pets, which then results in pets missing and also fireworks scare some pets from their homes,” said Fleischer.She said it has been hard to manage the increase with limited funding. “We have received no state funding for the work we do. Love and compassion cost nothing but pet food, veterinary equipment and supplies, vehicles for transporting rescued animals, cost us and we are struggling without funding,” said Fleischer.She added that this increase in pets that need to be rescued, will be expected until winter because that Is when animals are stable and do not wander around. Fleischer further urged pet owners to ensure their pets are microchipped as it is the best and easiest way for pets to get back to owners in the event that they get lost. A microchip is a tiny electronic microcircuit sealed into a biocompatible glass tube that is 11mm long and 2mm wide (about the size of a grain of rice). When inserted,s it is painless and its function is to help the SPCA track the pet owner. Fleischer advices the public to please visit them if they have lost their pets or call the Kennels department during office hours which are Monday to Friday at 8am to 4pm and on Saturday at 8am to12.30pm. To complete a lost pet report, the public can call 031 579 6524/6 or email lostandfound@spcadbn.org.za.
