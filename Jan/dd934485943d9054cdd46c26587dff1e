A woman was shot in her shoulder and her son was shot at when a gang of armed robbers brazenly kicked down the kitchen door and fled with a television and DVR on Gilliam Road, in the early hours of Friday morning. Phoenix SAPS communications officer, Captain L Naidoo, said that the complainant alleges that on Friday at 2am he was asleep in his house when he heard screaming coming from downstairs.“He ran downstairs and noticed an unknown man kicking the kitchen door. The complainant shouted at the man who then fired one gunshot at the complainant. The complainant ran back upstairs fearing for his life. While upstairs, the complainant claims he heard a further three shots being fired. He also heard his mother screaming and the complainant jumped out of his upstairs window into neighbour’s yard. His wife jumped out of the other window into the back yard. Whilst the complainant was in his neighbour’s yard, he saw about five suspects running away with a television and DVR,” Naidoo said.She said that the complainant then went back into the house and found his mother in a pool of blood. She had sustained a single gunshot wound to the right shoulder. The house was also ransacked. A case of House robbery is being investigated. No arrests have been made,” added Cpt Naidoo. Phoenix CPF chairman, Umesh Singh, slammed the incident and said criminals are too ruthless in the face of their criminality.“An elder woman was shot because these marauding thugs are merciless and relentless. The suspects were so audacious in that they kicked down the kitchen door. They also came in a large gang because they were determined to leave with loot. We urge residents not to antagonise these armed and dangerous suspects. Your life is not worth losing over material possessions,” added Singh.
