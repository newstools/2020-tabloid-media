An Overport resident bravely defended his life and shot at an armed gang who opened fire on him as he arrived at a property on Kenilworth Road, from the bank, on Saturday. Sydenham SAPS communications officer, Captain Myen Lazarus, said: “Police are investigating a case of attempted armed robbery after a complainant was approached by armed suspects who were masked and had gloves. The suspects opened fire on the complainant who returned fire striking one suspect.” Lazarus said that it is alleged that the suspects followed the complainant from the bank. “Members of the public are urged to refrain from making large withdrawals and rather use electronic banking facilities. The shot suspect is still in hospital under police guard,” he added. Private security PT Alarms who was patrolling in the area responded to the scene minutes after the shooting. Spokesperson for PT Alarms, Dhevan Govindasamy, said:“It is alleged that the suspects believed to be travelling in a white Toyota Etios confronted the resident who was entering his property. The suspects opened fire on the resident who returned fire. One suspect who had a balaclava and gloves on, was injured and left behind. The other suspects fled. A firearm was seized.” Lazarus confirmed that a firearm was recovered and will be sent for ballistics testing to determine if it has been used in the commission of other crimes in the province.
