The state’s bid to procure evidence collection kits for rape, regarded as a scourge in South Africa, at police stations has cost the treasury almost R500m. So said Police Minister Bheki Cele in a written reply to Parliament last week. He said the massive contract was awarded to Acino Forensics last year. The collection kits, commonly known as rape kits, are used to collect DNA evidence from victims of sexual crimes. Over the years, a number of rapists were jailed for life by our courts. In the majority of those cases the DNA evidence sealed the fate of the rapists. However, some accused charged for rape walked free because the DNA evidence was weak.     Said Cele: ” Police did not have contracts in place in 2017 and 2018. Despite calling for bidders, the bids received in those years had not met the requirements. Before Acino Forensics got the contract, evidence collection kits were procured on a quotation basis from three service providers: Batho Pele Health, Letsepe Investments and Yhira Investments.Cele revealed the information while responding to a question from DA MP Andrew Whitfield, who wanted to know which companies were awarded contracts to provide rape kits in 2017, 2018 and 2019, and the value of each contract.Whitfield disclosed last year that 78 percent of stations  did not have adult rape kits. On the other hand 69 percent of stations did not have child rape kits. In his parliamentary response, Cele said police used 16 different types of evidence collection kits to collect samples at crime scenes. “These include the two types of evidence collection kits – the adult sexual assault collection kit and the paediatric sexual assault collection kit – which are used to collect evidence from victims of sexual assault and rape,” he said.“The deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) reference buccal sample kits are used to take buccal samples from people charged for serial murders and serial rapes,” said Cele.
