A 2. 4 metre Black Mamba caused a stir at a Redcliffe factory and had employees both panicked and in awe after making an appearance at the premises, on Monday morning. Reaction Unit South Africa (RUSA) was called out to the premises on Oakford Road at about 11.30 am. “Upon arrival, reaction officers were directed to a stack of wooden pallets which were removed from inside the business premises. When RUSA members approached  the pallet, they found a huge Black Mamba coiled up inside. Snake catcher, Jason Arnold from Universal Reptiles was called out to the premises. The snake was captured and later released into the wild,” RUSA boss, Prem Balram, said.
