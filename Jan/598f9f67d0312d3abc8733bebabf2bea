An alleged house robber was killed in a shoot-out following a high speed chase on the N2 near Sibaya on Friday, and his accomplice is still at large. According to Reaction Unit South Africa (RUSA) head, Prem Balram, the incident unfolded when RUSA received a call from Tracker requesting assistance in stopping a Toyota Rav that was taken during a home invasion in Stanger. “The vehicle was travelling south on the N2 and was being pursued by several law enforcement agencies. During the chase, the suspects opened fire on first responders who returned fire at the getaway vehicle. The suspects rammed into a pursuing Toyota Hilux bakkie and a VW Amarok. The gunmen lost control of their vehicle which veered off the highway and crashed into a tree in the centre median,” said Balram. He said the robbers continued firing as they crossed the north bound lane on foot. “One suspect was shot and killed whilst his accomplice fled into a bush adjacent to the highway. A 9mm pistol with an extended magazine was found next to the deceased. The RUSA Robinson R44 helicopter was called out and conducted an aerial search of the area, however, the remaining suspect is still at large,” Balram added. According to Balram, a first responder suffered minor injuries after a bullet travelled through the door of his VW Amarok bakkie and struck him on his side. “The bakkie was shot at multiple times during the chase. The suspects’ vehicle was taken in a house robbery in Mtunzini, on Friday morning,” he added. Members of Reaction Unit South Africa, IPSS, SAPS, RTI and Tracker searched the area for the runaway suspect but to no avail.
