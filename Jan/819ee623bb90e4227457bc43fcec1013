Just hours before the New Year could be celebrated, a family suffered a double whammy when they were hijacked by armed suspects and their baby girl was driven away by the hijackers, in Kwadabeka. According to Crisis Medical spokesperson, Kyle Van Reenen, the vehicle in question, a white Toyota Hilux had been taken by three armed men who had sped off with the owner’s baby girl still strapped into her car seat. “The Hilux was fitted with a satellite tracking device monitored by Netstar and the owner began relaying information from his smartphone application to the South African Police Services, community and WhatsApp
groups, who activated the necessary resources as the vehicle was headed towards the Inanda area,” van Reenen said. He said that the suspects abandoned the baby in her car seat near the Inanda police station where she
was found by passing police members. “The vehicle was tracked and found off the main road in the Amatikwe area. The suspects fled on foot and remain at large. The little girl was assessed by a Crisis Medical paramedic and was found to be in good spirits and not to have suffered any injury in the ordeal. She was reunited with a very relieved family,” he added. Van Reenen said the vehicle was handed over to the South African Police Services for further investigation and processing.
