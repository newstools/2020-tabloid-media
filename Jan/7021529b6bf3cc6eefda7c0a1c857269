For many “The Ultimate Gift” is a flashy car or the latest cellular phone, for others it is to have a meal. The Ultimate Gift (TUG) NPO is a rapidly growing Facebook group which has taken the community by storm.The initiative was founded by Cheryl Naidoo in May 2019 and is smoothly run by a team of nine admins. The group is inundated with requests daily and very few go unfulfilled. The Ultimate Gift aims to feed as many people as they can, and providing them with basic essentials.Many have been inspired by the acts of kindness – The Ultimate Gift members have started feeding programs in various communities including Martha Linderboom in Clare Estate and Ricky Shunmugam in Phoenix.“In the past 10 months, we have been servicing the community, providing clothes, food, toys, toiletries, uniforms and stationery to disadvantaged families. In December, we were able to host a party for 100 disadvantaged children who were invited to a fun-filled day and spoilt with gifts, activities and many other spoils,” said Naidoo.She said that they also distributed close to 300 food hampers over the festive season and aim to touch as many lives as possible and spread as much love and kindness as they can. “Together we make it possible,” added Naidoo.
