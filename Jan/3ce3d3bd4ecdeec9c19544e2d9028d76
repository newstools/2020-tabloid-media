Reading out aloud and storytelling are some of the great ways to get young people interested reading and to help them improve on their literacy. The Nelson Mandela Community Youth Centre together with Nal’ibali, an NGO that focusses on storytelling and reading, are teaming up for World Read Aloud Day on Wednesday, 5 February. Annually thousands of people join the Read Aloud campaign by reading for 15 minutes, to pupils in a classroom or at a school assembly, and parents are encouraged to read to their children at home. As an ambassador for the campaign, Jailoshni Naidoo recently held a reading session with children at the Bayview Library. Naidoo is the ambassador of the Read Aloud campaign at the Nelson Mandela Youth Centre. She said her passion for reading and wanting to get children reading it more often is what made her want to be part of the campaign. “Help us make sure every parent understands the power of daily reading aloud, starting at birth. We want to also encourage educators to join in this great effort by reading a story on Read Aloud Day. There is huge potential to turn our literacy crisis around so that reading becomes a powerful tool for early literacy efforts,” Naidoo said. You too can be part of the Read Aloud Campaign by collecting a registration form and a Nal’ibali story from the youth centre. Naidoo said reading aloud to children improves vocabulary and introduces new words to them. She added: “The campaign raises awareness on the importance of reading aloud for children’s literacy development. It is also is an important and exciting first step to ensuring we keep a habit of reading alive in our homes, classrooms, and communities throughout the year, if we want to ensure our children have the best possible chance of succeeding at school and in life.” For more information on how to be part of World Read Aloud Day, contact Clive Pillay from the youth centre on 061 429 2574.
