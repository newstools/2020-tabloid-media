 A 62-year-old Phoenix man’s wife, domestic helper and two other women were arrested and will appear in court after they attempted to suffocate and strangle him in his home, yesterday. The four women, aged between 38 and 53, have been arrested for attempted murder and conspiracy to murder. They will appear at Verulam Magistrate’s Court tomorrow. Phoenix SAPS communications officer, Cpt L Naidoo, said, “It’s alleged that at about 17.30 on Wednesday, the complainant (62) was seated in the lounge at his residence on Wheatbrook Avenue, in Brookdale, and he was watching TV when the ordeal unfolded. The complainant was approached by three women who covered his head with a bin bag and two of the women began throttling him with a scarf. When he managed to remove the bag, he discovered that one of his assailants was his maid.” Cpt Naidoo added, “They began to struggle with one another until they got to his bedroom where the struggle to throttle and suffocate him continued. The suspects were then joined by the victim’s wife. She also tried to suffocate him with a bin bag. He managed to activate the panic button. The neighbour came to his rescue and all the suspects were arrested. The wife made an admission to the police that she and her husband are separated but occupy the same house. She claimed that they have plenty of personal differences. She further claimed that she planned the entire incident with the maid for a reward of R4, 000.” Naidoo said an arrest was effected immediately by the neighbour who was duly assisted by members from a security company.
