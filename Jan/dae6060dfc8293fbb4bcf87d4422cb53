According to KZN police spokesperson, Captain Nqobile Gwala, members of Umbilo SAPS assisted by the Hawks and Durban Search and Rescue discovered the various types of ammunitions at a house in Evans Road, Umbilo on Wednesday. “The sheriff of the court requested the presence of the police as he was to evict the person who has occupied the house without paying rent. It is alleged that when the police and sheriff visited the house in Umbilo, the person that was to be evicted was not present.“The domestic worker was in the house and while the sheriff was busy taking the properties out of the house, the police discovered multiple components of bullet reloading set-up. A total number of 668 various types of ammunitions, 3, 840 bullet casings, gun powder and three fake passports were discovered in the basement. A rifle was also recovered at the same house,” said Gwala.
