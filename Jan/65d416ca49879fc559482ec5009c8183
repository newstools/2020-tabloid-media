Phoenix police came under fire when they attempted to halt two suspicious men in Grove-end, recently. According to Phoenix SAPS communications officer, Captain Louise Naidoo, police members were patrolling the Grove-end area near Kylemore Close on Tuesday night when they noticed two men dressed in dark clothing who were behaving suspiciously on the road. “The members requested that the two men stop so that they could search them. Both the men began to flee on foot and while they were running away, one of the men drew out a firearm and began shooting at the police members. Constable Cossa then also drew his firearm and returned fire. The suspects fled on foot on seeing that they were also under fire. None of the members were injured during the shooting and the suspects managed to get away. A case of Attempted Murder is being investigated and no arrest have been made as yet,” said Cpt Naidoo. She said that they are pleased to note that the police members were not injured in the shooting. “Suspects are prowling the streets looking for soft targets. We urge residents to beef-up security at their homes and be security conscious at all times. Do not be lax and put yourself in a position to be a victim. Police and CPF patrollers are vigilant and urge residents to do the same and report all suspicious persons to the police, neighbourhood watch group or security service provider,” said Phoenix CPF chairman, Umesh Singh.
