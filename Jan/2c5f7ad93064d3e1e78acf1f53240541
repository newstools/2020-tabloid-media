A special Celebration Concert for the late Steve Fataar is to be held at the UKZN Centre for Jazz, at Howard campus on Sunday, 26 January, from 2pm to 5pm. Durban’s much loved music legend, Fataar, died on Saturday morning, 18 January. This is a first of a joint family and friends event celebrating the life of Fataar. The family said that the celebrations will kick off in true Steve Fataar style, as he lived his life. An all inclusive programme, curated by Steve’s family, his musical family and circle of friends will be a moment of celebration and reflection, with invited persons participating. Friends and fans are requested to join the Fataar family with precious memories and allow this moment of healing to settle in. This is one of many initiatives evolving with many friends celebrating the legend and the music of The Flames, in weeks and months to come. On Sunday, parking will be available at the university premises. Light snacks will be served. The event is free and all people are welcome.
