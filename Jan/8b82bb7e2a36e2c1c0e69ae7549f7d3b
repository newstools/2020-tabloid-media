Metered taxi owners have warned of simmering tensions between taxi associations and e-hailing taxis, in and around the City of eThekwini. In recent weeks, Chatsworth has become one of the ‘no-go areas’ for Bolt and Uber drivers, who have been threatened out of the area. Charles Luthuli (not his real name), an Uber driver, said: “I hardly ever want to go inside Chatsworth anymore, I was hijacked at gunpoint and left in a bush somewhere in Umlazi.” The incident that happened to Luthuli, has become a regular occurrence for e-hailing taxi drivers. “I have no doubt that these hijackings are not random. We are being targeted and some of us are just employees and not the owners of the vehicles,” Luthuli said. The conflict between the taxi industry and the app-driven meter taxis has left drivers fearful of picking up clients in the Chatsworth area. Gareth Taylor, the South African manager for Bolt, formerly known as Taxify, said they were aware of friction between taxi drivers and ride-hailing drivers in Durban and Pinetown. He said: “Bolt condemns any violence, intimidation or extortion directed towards ride-hailing drivers, meter taxis or anyone who earns a living through transport services. Bolt believes that every South African has the right to earn a living without risk of harm, intimidation or coercion.” Uber spokesperson, Samantha Fuller, said: “We continue to engage with the relevant departments on regulations and policies that take into account new forms of mobility.”
