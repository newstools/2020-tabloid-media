Fed-up Merebank residents who are tired of being sitting ducks for criminals, took a pro-active stance against crime in the area and initiated the White Light project, recently. The initiative affords patrollers the opportunity to patrol crime-ridden streets with police approved flashing white lights for greater visibility. Residents, neighbourhood patrollers and community police forum members gathered in their numbers and gave the project the thumbs up. A convoy of vehicles flashed white lights during the launch. Wentworth police officers, security companies and PR councillor, S Ngema, lent their support to the initiative. Residents applauded the motorcade which drew great attention. Police did a sterling job in controlling the traffic. Ngema said, “This initiative shows that Merebank residents especially those in China Town have had enough of crime. They are going to fight against crime until the area becomes a crime free zone. The incidents that happened recently in the area were shocking and a lesson in disguise that criminals are armed to the teeth and have attacked poor people who can’t defend themselves. I will continue to support such initiatives as a PR councillor in the area.” Local security company, PT Alarms were out in full force to support the dedicated efforts of residents and spokesperson, Dhevan Govindasamy, said, “We are keen on helping residents who are committed to fighting crime in their areas. It is a good sign to note that these residents are working in conjunction with police, the local councillor and security companies to strive to keep their streets crime free. They are working within the ambits of the law and must be commended for their zeal and sacrifices.”
