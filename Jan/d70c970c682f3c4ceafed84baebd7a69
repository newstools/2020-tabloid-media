The body of Liam Wyndham Nortjie, who was reported missing on 21 November 2017, has been found. This comes shortly after his father, Nantes Nortjie, was convicted of the murder of his son. Barely a few hours after his conviction in the Harrismith Hight Court, Liam’s body was discovered in a shallow grave in Harrismith while a resident was walking his dog. The accused never did reveal in court proceedings the whereabout of Liam’s remains. Police said that Liam was identified by his mother, Cheinelle Brooks, by the Spiderman shoes that he was wearing at the time of his disappearance. Nortjie pleaded not guilty to the charges against him and did not testify during his trail. He has already indicated that he will not appeal the verdict. Judge CornÃ© van Zyl found that the state proved beyond reasonable doubt, that Liam was murdered, despite no proof of a body. The accused was arrested in Ladysmith and was incarcerated in Harrismith. Nortjie still maintains that Laim is alive. A massive search by SAPS search and rescue units from Ladysmith, Harrismith and Pietermaritzburg were conducted in August 2018 after claims that Liam was seen in Ladysmith. Police spent weeks in Ladysmith searching for the toddler. Despite following up on leads, Liam was not found. A local business assisted in the search by having pamphlets distributed. At the time of his disappearance, Liam’s parents became estranged. His father was living in Kestell in the Free State, while his mother lived in Harrismith. Liam lived with his father while he visited his mother over the weekends.
