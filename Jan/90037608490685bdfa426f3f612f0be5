‘Tap and go’ bank card fraud is on the rise and eThekwini Outer South Cluster (EOS) SAPS has warned the public to be on their guard.EOS communications officer, Captain Carmen Rhynes, said, “Fraudsters are now defrauding people off their monies through the ‘tap and go’ latest invented system.Technology is always improving to make life easier, but criminals also are finding new ways of defrauding people. The new bank card ‘tap and go’ system is designed in a way that when the cardholder makes a purchase, there is no need to  key in a pin code; you just tap the card on the card machine and the sale goes through. This is indeed a convenient way to shop, but this system has created an opportunity for fraudsters and it makes it easier for them to steal cards and purchase anything they wish without them having to key in a pin number.” “The public is advised to disable this option on their bank cards and use the old traditional way, where one puts in their card into the card machine and key in their pin code. It is also advisable to set a very low limit on the ‘tap and go’ for small purchases for your convenience. A limit as low as R200 will avoid the possibility of being defrauded of a large sum of money. Should the purchase be more than the set limit, a pin will be required. She added, “The public is also urged to be extra vigilant when they are at ATMs withdrawing money as most fraudsters interfere with ATM machines and pretend to help the victims. They swap cards leaving you with a fake card while taking your original card. Always ensure you have the correct card with you at all times. Should you suspect that your card has been stolen or cloned, it is in your best interest to report the card immediately to your bank.”
