Mohamed Vahed Ebrahim, 44, the murderer accused in the Miguel Louw case, was denied his application to have the charges against him withdrawn in the Durban High Court, on Monday. Judge Jacqueline Hendriques delivered her judgement on Monday morning and closing arguments have been set down for 21 and 22 February.The refusal to withdraw the charges by the judge prompted Ebrahim to opt out of testifying. His defence attorney, Advocate Jay Naidoo, closed the defence’s case without calling any witnesses or Ebrahim himself to testify.He initially called for the charges against Ebrahim to be dismissed on the grounds that the State’s evidence against the accused was weak and insufficient and added that the State relied on circumstantial evidence which was not conclusive in proving crimes of murder and kidnapping.Ebrahim’s version of events on the fateful day that Miguel disappeared, remains that he bought Miguel a meal at the Sydenham KFC and then boarded a taxi, leaving the boy to walk home alone.Miguel disappeared on 17 July 2018 after leaving his Rippon Road Primary School and going to the local KFC in Sydenham with Ebrahim.The Grade 4 pupil’s decomposed body was discovered in a shallow grave near Ebrahim’s home in Longbury, Phoenix, in September, two months after his disappearance. The court since heard about Ebrahim’s relationship with Miguel’s mother, Raylene Louw, as a work colleague in a butchery and thereafter as a boyfriend, as Ebrahim claimed.Ebrahim’s attorney, Adv Naidoo attempted to cast suspicion on Miguel’s uncle, Mike Louw as a suspect in the murder, as he claimed Mike was in a relationship with Miguel’s mother. The attempt was dismissed by the State who maintained that Ebrahim was the prime suspect as all evidence led to him.
