It is the beginning of the year and The Baby House Westville is appealing for donations. The Baby House is a safe home for abandoned babies, fully dependent on sponsors and donations, and are currently in need of items which include fresh milk, chicken, mince, maas, batteries spoons (adults) a grass broom, potatoes, onions, black bin bags and Lactogen baby milk. Terri Wentzel from the home said that the babies come to them through a registered social worker and they stay with them until either they are reunited with biological family or are adopted into forever families which can be anything from 2 to 3 days to 2 years. “The house needs anything a normal family, large family home would use.” Wentzel also encouraged members of the community to continue visiting the home and giving some love to the children. “The community and individuals who would like too volunteer their time at the house are always welcome, as it takes a little to make a big difference in the life of a vulnerable child,” she said.  For more information, please contact Terri Wentzel on 061 125 0887 or Nola Smoreburg on 083 247 1423 and by emailing thebabyhousewestville@gmail.com.
