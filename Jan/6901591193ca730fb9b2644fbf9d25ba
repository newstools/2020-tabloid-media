Police swooped on two men suspected of dealing in rhino horns and elephant tusks following a sting operation in the Point area, on Monday.KZN police spokesperson, Brigadier Jay Naicker, said that the two men could not hide their excitement when they received a call from a potential buyer. While they were excited to meet the buyer, things turned sour when they were confronted by police outside a hotel in the Point. According to Naicker, police officers from the Point police station received information that the two men were in possession of elephant tusks in the Point and a sting operation was set up. The suspects were contacted by police and an appointment was set up to meet outside a busy hotel in the Point.“A police officer from Point SAPS proceeded to the said location and requested to see the product. Without hesitation, the suspects led the undercover police officer to their vehicle. The men were stunned and they knew it was all over for them when they were confronted by police officers from the Point Rapid Response Team, together with the Endangered Species Unit. “Their vehicle was searched and four elephant tusks were seized. The total weight of the tusks was 16,88kg and they have an estimated value of R300 000.The two men aged 35 and 56 were arrested for possession and dealing in ivory. They will appear in the Durban Magistrates Court,” said Naicker. The KwaZulu-Natal provincial commissioner, Lieutenant General Khombinkosi Jula commended the police officers from Point SAPS for gathering the intelligence and for initiating the take-down operation. “KwaZulu-Natal is not a playground for criminals and it is a lesson that these criminals learnt the hard way. We have recently dealt a heavy blow to criminals who trade in illicit and counterfeit goods and we will remain relentless in our pursuit for a crime free society,” Jula said.
