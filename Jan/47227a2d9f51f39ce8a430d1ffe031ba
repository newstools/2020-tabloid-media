The community of Chatsworth has been invited to support the fundraising efforts of the Aryan Benevolent Home (ABH), by attending their next Charity Store sale. The shop is open Monday to Friday, from 8am to 4pm. Nirode Bramdaw, ABH’s spokesperson and council member, said the sale kicked-off on 10 January, and will run until the end of this month. “The store sells both pre-loved and new clothes, shoes and furniture. The ABH separates their donations into sales and those for the residents. They ensure that everything donated benefits the 1000 residents that they care for,” Bramdaw said. The store is located at the ABH’s headquarters on 80 Arena Park Drive, Chatsworth. All funds raised will be used to benefit ABH residents. “The ABH is a long-standing charity organisation that offers care and shelter to the aged and frail, victims of violence and abuse, children and the mentally and physically challenged, and is reliant on the generosity of donors to keep their residents in good care,” Bramdaw said. The store also opens on the last Saturday of the month from 8am to 1pm. “We encourage our community to visit the ABH Charity Store. If you would like to donate clothes, shoes and furniture to the ABH Charity Store, please drop off your items at our headquarters. The store has been well supported by both donors and patrons and is an important income stream in ABH’s efforts to meet its monthly deficit, so that they can ensure the best possible care for the residents,” Bramdaw said.For further information about the ABH Charity Store, call Vinay Nunthkumar on 084 477 7666 or 031 404 9530.
