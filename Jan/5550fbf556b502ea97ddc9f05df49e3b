A search is ongoing for a gang of hijackers who fled with a cache of delivery goods including high valued items such as cellphones after they allegedly hijacked a courier company bakkie from Parkgate and abandoned the vehicle in Zwelisha, on Friday. According to RUSA boss, Prem Balram, at approximately 8.11am, members of Reaction Unit South Africa (RUSA) were returning from a callout in Zwelisha when they noticed a white VW Polo and a grey Toyota Corolla with four occupants each, exiting a dirt road at high speed. An Isuzu bakkie was parked on the unpaved road. The vehicle was branded and the back door was open.He said while attempting to contact the courier company to confirm the location of the driver, the RUSA operations centre received a call from a resident of Heathrow Avenue, reporting a hijacking.”The caller confirmed that at least eight suspects had hijacked an Isuzu bakkie belonging to a courier company. The driver and his assistant were dumped on the roadside and the suspects sped-off with their vehicle which was fully loaded with parcels. Some of the parcels were high valued items which included cellular phones.  “The hijacked bakkie was followed by the suspects’ vehicles which included a white VW Polo and a grey Toyota Corolla. The information was relayed to reaction officers who confirmed the recovery of the bakkie. All the high valued parcels were stolen from the bakkie,” Balram added. He said reaction officers conducted a search for the suspects who fled in the direction of Inanda but no arrests were made.
