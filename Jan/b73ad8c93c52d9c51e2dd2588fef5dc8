An alleged knife-wielding housebreaker was shot and injured when he lunged at a Blue Security armed response officer in Glenmore, in the early hours of Saturday morning. Blue Security community and media liaison officer Andreas Mathios said the armed response officer was responding to a panic alarm activation when he spotted three suspects jumping over the driveway gate of a property. “The suspects, who were carrying a television and other stolen items, hid behind a tree when they saw the armed response vehicle approaching the property,” Mathios said. According to Mathios, the officer jumped out of his vehicle and pulled out his firearm, ordering the suspects to come out from behind the tree. “One of the suspects, who was armed with a knife, then ran towards the officer who fired several shots in the direction of the suspect. One of the shots hit the suspect in his leg,” he added. He said that the officer arrested two suspects at the scene. “One suspect remains at large. Rescue Care paramedics attended the scene of the crime and treated the injured suspect’s gunshot wound. The suspects were handed over to the Umbilo SAPS at the scene of the crime,” Mathios said. Mathios commended the officer for his swift response to the scene that led to the arrests.”Our team is committed to fighting crime in Glenmore and surrounding areas and to working closely with the community’s neighbourhood watch groups and the police to bring criminals to book,” Mathios said.
