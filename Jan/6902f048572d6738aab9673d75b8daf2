Community torches alleged suspect’s shelter. Cato Manor police are investigating a rape after a seven-year-old girl was allegedly sexually violated by a local man at a transit camp in the area, on Saturday. KZN police spokesperson, Colonel Thembeka Mbele, said: “The incident took place on 18 January 2020 at Emathinini Transit Camp in Cato Manor where a seven-year-old girl was allegedly raped by an unknown man. A case of rape was opened at Cato Manor police station for investigation.”According to media reports, following the disclosure of the horrific rape, residents of the transit camp sought street justice and in their fury they destroyed the unit where the alleged rapist is said to have dwelt, and torched his belongings. It is alleged that the locals found bloodstained sheets and upon viewing blood on the floor, they unleashed their wrath on the man’s shelter.A city official is cited as stating that the residents may have destroyed crucial evidence in the outpouring of their rage. It was reported that the girl’s mother only found out about the brutal rape when she saw her daughter’s underwear soaked with blood and the girl was in severe pain. The child was rushed to hospital after police and neighbours were informed of the crime. Revelations about the rape allege that the girl was at a church close to her home and stepped out to drink water when the suspect lured and raped her.
