Ladysmith added to the tally of babies born in KwaZulu-Natal born on New Year’s day. It was a happy occasion for three mothers who gave birth to their bundles of joy at the Ladysmith Provincial Hospital. A total of 95 babies, 47 boys and 48 girls, were born in the province on 1 January. Amanda Zwane from Uitval gave birth to her first child, a girl, who was the first new arrival for 2020 shortly after midnight. Another mother, Fikile Maphumulo from Ladysmith gave birth to her second baby, a girl. This was the second delivery. Ezakheni’s Thabeke Holtshwayo gave birth to her second child, and the first boy to arrive on New Year’s Day. He was named Lusenhle. Zwane and Maphumulo both told the Ladysmith Herald that they were delighted with the arrival of their baby girls. They said that they will wait for their families to help name the babies. Holtshwayo was all smiles as proudly showed off her son and second child. “Im so happy. What a double celebration for me and my family.” Nurses from the hospital sang and danced in the hall ways as they welcomed the New Year’s baby.
