Reconciliation Day was one to go down in the history books as president Cyril Ramaphosa paid a visit to the Okhahlamba Local Municipality where an eager crowd waited for him at the Bergville Sports Complex. Hundreds of people flocked to the centre to participate in the celebrations and catch a glimpse of the president on 16 December. Minister of Arts and Culture Nathi Mthethwa said that this day was declared by the United Nations to preserve indigenous languages. Delivering his keynote address Ramaphosa said that like many parts of the country Okhahlamba reminded audience that this day was declared by the Afrikaners as the Day of Vow after they defeated the Zulus in 1838. “It was also the day when uMkhonto Wesizwe was formed. After the democratic dispensation government renamed it Reconciliation Day. It is important to recall how indigenous people were forced off their land by colonial rulers,” said Ramaphosa. He emphasised that reconciliation was about healing the wounds of the past by ensuring that there is peace and harmony among various groups of people. He urged people to work together to resolve the issue of land dispute between landowners and the dispossessed. He said he was going to come back to the area to launch the District Development Model in order to better understand the issues of the community.
