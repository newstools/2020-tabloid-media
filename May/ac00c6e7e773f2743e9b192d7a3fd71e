A number of destitute families across Chatsworth are facing hunger as dwindling funds for food hampers being distributed by the Coronavirus Action Committee (Covac) are slowly drying up. Covac said there is a long list of people that have applied for food hampers and they are helpless because there might not be enough funds to reach everyone in need. Clive Pillay from Covac said a number of community organisations are doing their best to assist with food hampers but they are starting to find great difficulty in sustaining what they have started. “We still have a long list of people that have applied for food hampers. Our volunteers see the hardship people are experiencing when they are on the ground delivering hampers to deserving families. In many families nobody is working or children that would have been getting food from the school feeding programme are now at home hungry,” Pillay said. Over the last six weeks, the volunteer group has distributed over 4000 sizable food hampers with a value of R250 each. They distributed to poor families in Chatsworth, Welbedacht, Mariannhill, Wentworth, Lamontville and places as far off as Umzinto. They are now appealing to businesses, organizations and individuals to contribute to the fund that will ensure more poor families benefit from the campaign.
Pillay said: “We also want to start four soup kitchens in very poor communities. We believe this will have a great impact in alleviating the hunger people are experiencing.” For information on how to contribute to the food hamper campaign, contact Clive Pillay on 061 429 2574.
