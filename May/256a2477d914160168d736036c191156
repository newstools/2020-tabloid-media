 Authorities took a hard stance against businesses flouting regulations, bylaws and Covid-19 lockdown rules during a crackdown of illegal activity in the Isipingo area in a three day blitz recently, held in partnership with the provincial Department of Economic Development Tourism and Environmental Affairs (EDTEA), SAPS, Department of Home Affairs, Department of Labour and other authorities. Traders and businesses alike were inspected, and no one was spared in the operation. A supermarket in Isipingo was fined R17 500 by the eThekwini Municipality’s Environmental Health unit for operating under filthy conditions, selling unwholesome food, having broken toilets and no change room facilities for staff, smoking on the premises, amongst other contraventions. Sifiso Xulu, Isipingo Regeneration Chairperson said: “At least 13 businesses were closed for non-compliance and not having a licence to trade. Five food outlet owners were arrested. In one instance, 21 people were inside a hair salon that is not allowed to trade during lockdown.
Metro Police also removed more than three tons of stolen property from informal traders and arrested at least 15 people for various offenses.” He added: “People in the area are not concerned about lockdown regulations and are not practising social distancing or wearing masks. With Isipingo being a hotspot for Covid-19, more of these raids will be conducted until people get the message that non-compliance will not be tolerated.” Buildings were inspected for proper water and electricity connections, compliance with building, fire, and health regulations and various notices and fines were issued.
