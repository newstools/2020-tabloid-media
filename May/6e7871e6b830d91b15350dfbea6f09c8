President Cyril Ramaphosa made a whirlwind visit to Durban on Tuesday to assess the province’s response plans to Covid-19. KZN ranks among the highest areas for coronavirus infections and records almost half the number of deaths in the country. While the government has eased the lockdown to level four, communities have emerged on the streets in their numbers and many outlets that were closed during the lockdown have re-opened, including many non-essential businesses. The president was welcomed by the minister of health Dr Zweli Mkhize, and KZN premier Sihle Zikalala as he arrived at the provincial command council centre in Mayville. Ramaphosa visited some of the provincial quarantine sites after lengthy engagements with the premier and health minister. Topping the agenda was the provincial government’s response strategies and progress being made to “flatten the curve” of the coronavirus pandemic. The president proceeded to the Dr Pixley Ka Isaka Seme Memorial Hospital in KwaMashu, which is one of the hospitals designated to manage Covid-19. Ramaphosa’s visit concluded with a walkabout at the Agricultural Royal Showgrounds in Pietermaritzburg which is another designated quarantine area and isolation facility for Covid-19 patients.
