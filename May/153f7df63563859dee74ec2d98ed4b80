The Department of Education in KwaZulu-Natal has postponed the return of teachers and school management teams (SMTs) to work, to allow for the smooth and deep disinfection of facilities. The KwaZulu-Natal Education MEC, Kwazi Mshengu announced on Monday morning (11 May), that they are not ready. Mshengu said: “We have opted to postpone the return of teachers and school management teams as announced by the basic education minister. We have done this to allow for the deep cleaning and sanitisation of schools, which was part of the non-negotiables agreed upon by all stakeholders.” This, after the Basic Education Minister Angie Motshekga, announced on 30 April that schools will re-open in phases. Teachers were expected to report for duty today, however, many provincial education departments have been urging principals and school management teams to not return to work today. It remains unclear at this stage, whether schools across the country will re-open for matric and Grade 7 pupils by 1 June. Mshengu explained: “This doesn’t mean that we will not be ready for the return of pupils on 1 June. As a department we always put the safety of pupils and teachers first.” Mshengu added that the demand for PPEs across the country has meant that it was impossible to get the stock at the required time. “We had to postpone to allow the proper delivery and the rest of the procurement of PPEs,” he said. It is believed that the Basic Education Minister will be having a meeting with all Education MECs today to discuss the re-opening of schools further. Meanwhile, two teachers’ unions, National Professional Teachers’ Organisation of South Africa (Naptosa) and Suid-Afrikaanse Onderwysersunie (Saou), have vowed that their members will not return to work if the non-negotiables have not been complied with.
