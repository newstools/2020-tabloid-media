A horrific fatal accident on the N2 north bound lane just after the Tongaat tollgate, claimed the lives of two women, who were mowed down while changing a flat tyre, last night (Sunday,18 May). IPSS Medical Rescue spokesperson, Paul Herbst, said that it is believed that two females were traveling from Tongaat towards Ballito when they got a flat tyre. “The driver pulled the vehicle on to the emergency lane and both females started to change the tyre, when a second vehicle rear-ended them. On arrival of IPSS paramedics, both females were found some distance from the vehicle,” Herbst said. “Unfortunately, both females showed no signs of life and were declared dead. One of the females lower limb was amputated during the collision. With the assistance of K9 Dante from Umhlali SAPS K9 Search and Rescue, the limb was recovered and handed over to authorities,” added Herbst. He said the driver of the second vehicle escaped unharmed.
