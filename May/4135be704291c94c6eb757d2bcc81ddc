The Covid19 pandemic has been a stressful time for people all over the world, including the doctors… our frontline “Superheroes”. Popular Durban practitioner Dr Naseeba Kathrada (Dr Kats) got a few of her medical colleagues together to create an inspirational video ” We are here for you South Africa” – shot “together but seperate” by each of these frontline “superheroes” to the beat of the The Beatles’ popular song “Hey Jude” with words best suited for the current lockdown, that South Africans are experiencing. Dr Kats got talented singer John Cameron to sing the words she conceptualized.
