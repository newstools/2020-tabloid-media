Chatsworth Police station has been evacuated after a SAPS member tested positive for the novel coronavirus (Covid-19). National Police spokesperson, Brigadier Vish Naidoo has confirmed that a constable from Chatsworth SAPS tested positive for Covid-19. The member received her results on 25 May which she communicated to her commander on the same day. The member had last been to the police station on 18 May after having been on rest days. She booked off sick on 23 May when she was supposed to return to work. Brigadier Naidoo said: “On 25 May, when the member discovered that she tested positive for the virus, she did not return to work. The community service centre of the station has been evacuated and is currently undergoing a decontamination process and all members that may have possibly come into contact with the infected member have been requested to either go for screening or testing or both and that is currently underway.” Members of the community are urged to be patient with police. They can still report to the police station as a mobile client service centre has been set up outside the station. Community members will be attended to if they have any complaints or need any services. Naidoo said: “We expect that the station will resume normal operations on Thursday, 28 May, when the community service centre will be up and running again.”
