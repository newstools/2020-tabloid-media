This 5% of Covid-19 confirmed cases – consistent with hospitalization rates seen in China. Our mortality rate has remained stable at around 1.9% since the first death was reported. This is below the world average which is 3.4% as estimated by the World Health Organization. He reminded South Africans of the principle of flattening the curve so that the numbers do not rise and overburden the health system. As winter sets in we will be confronted with the additional burden of influenza and other pneumonias, bronchiolitis in children, exacerbations of asthma and chronic obstructive airways disease and winter related trauma like burn injuries. Dr Mkhize urged all South Africans to play their part in easing the load on the healthcare system by staying at home if going out is not required, wearing a mask in public, washing of hands and disinfecting surfaces. Employer’s whose business has opened up, need to take the necessary precautions to protect the employees.
