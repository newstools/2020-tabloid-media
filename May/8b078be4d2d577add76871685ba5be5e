South African Social Security Agency (SASSA) staff returned from Monday, 11 May, to work on a rotational basis to continue to render social services to communities. However, the services will be limited as offices open progressively. Sassa offices have been closed since the lockdown began in March. “In order to protect the most vulnerable members of society, Mondays and Tuesdays will be used to receive applications from older persons. Priority will be given to those citizens who turned 60 just prior to or during the lockdown period, who were unable to complete their applications before services were stopped,” said Zulu. “Wednesdays and Thursdays will be new applications for child support and foster child grants. Again priority will be given to care givers with new babies, instances where the care giver has to change or where circumstances have resulted in care givers having no income to support their children,” she said. Sassa is also adopting a risk-adjusted approach as it re-introduces services at offices. Zulu appealed that caregivers should not take children with them to SASSA offices to minimise the risk of the coronavirus infection. Children will not be allowed, all clients will be screened, hand sanitised and they must wear masks at all times.
