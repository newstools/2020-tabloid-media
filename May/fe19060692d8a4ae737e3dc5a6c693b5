Despite a first season of senior cricket that was blighted by injury, young quick Lifa Ntanzi finished it on a high when he made his  Hollywoodbets Dolphins debut and followed that up with securing a contract with the Durban-based franchise for the upcoming season.Hailing from Umlazi, Ntanzi is one of the shining lights for the KZNCU, DSR  & Sunfoil Township & Rural Development Programme as he was  earmarked through the initiative to attend Glenwood High School.From here the speedster earned a South African Schools call-up and then was selected for the South Africa Under 19 side, however he missed the 2019  World Cup due to injury.To receive a franchise contract was a  dream come true for the 18 year-old, but he says the recognition was as  much an achievement for him as it was for some of the people that have  helped him through his career.“My parents were really, really  happy when I told them that I had got a Dolphins contract,” Ntanzi said.  “Not only them but also my coaches from Umlazi Cricket Club because I  am the first player from the club to get a franchise contract.“They were so happy for me but it also shows how important the work is that they do in the township.”Ntanzi has taken on the mantle of role model for those in the township that might want to pursue a career in cricket.“I  think that it’s important for me to be able to be an example for the  young boys and girls in Umlazi and I hope that I can encourage as many  young children to play cricket and follow their dreams.”Ntanzi,  along with fellow young signing Andile Mogakane, made his debut for the  Dolphins in their Momentum One Day Cup clash with the Imperial Lions in  Potchefstroom and it was a day he will never forget.“To make my  debut for the Dolphins was so special,” he reminisced. “I knew that I  had just come back from injury but I had to give my best and I think it  went well for me.“To be in a side with so many great cricketers was a dream come true and I cannot wait to get the new season started.”Ntanzi  has been earmarked as one of the next best as he was supposed to take  part in a fast bowlers camp with South African bowling coach Charl  Langeveldt during the winter. This was cancelled due to the spread of  the coronavirus.With his winter programme on its head Ntanzi is  just trying to keep a narrow focus before he is able to return to action  later in the year.“I think that the moment I just need to  concentrate on staying fit,” he commented. “Gavin Muir and the Dolphins  and Brendan Jackson have been working closely with me and I want to  thank Gavin for all his hard work.“If I can keep fit and then get myself into the Dolphins side then I’ll be very happy.”He’s  got a number of experienced bowlers around him at the Dolphins but  singled out Daryn Dupavillon as someone who has played a big role in a  short period of time.“I think because we are similar bowlers he has been great in telling me how I should go about things.“He is supportive and I find that he is a great person to learn from,” he added.
