A Verulam father, who terrorised his family by firing a gunshot inside their Surya Heights home on Tuesday evening (19 May), was apprehended and charged for discharging a firearm in an urban area. It is alleged that the 37-year-old father, had an argument with his wife before firing a gunshot that struck the ceiling of their bedroom. He was later arrested by a joint operation between members of Reaction Unit South Africa (Rusa) and Verulam SAPS. Prem Balram of Rusa, said that the members also seized a 9mm pistol, which was fired by the suspect in the house with his wife and children. “Our operations centre received a call from a frantic female at approximately 6.29pm, requesting for immediate assistance after her 37-year-old male neighbour used her cellphone to contact his wife and children who were hiding inside the house. She overheard the conversation with his younger child and realised that the man was contemplating suicide,” he said. Balram said that the man then handed the cellphone to its owner before returning to his home. “The father broke the door locks and gained entry into the home. A gunshot was heard few minutes later. The neighbour believed that the father had committed suicide and phoned Rusa for assistance,” he said. Balram explained that members arrived at the premises and found the man outside the home. “He was uninjured and informed members that his wife had left their marital home with his children. He said that during a heated argument he threatened to shoot himself. He denied using his firearm,” said Balram. Balram added that when neighbours insisted that they had heard a gunshot sound, the father then informed members that he had fired a single round inside his bedroom that struck the ceiling. Balram said that used cartridge was found on the floor of the bedroom. The father was arrested and detained at the Verulam police station. Verulam SAPS could not be found for comment.
