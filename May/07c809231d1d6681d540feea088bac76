Minister of Higher Education, Science and Innovation, Blade Nzimande briefed the nation on the plans for the 2020 academic year, on Thursday, 30 April. In a televised address, he said that during the Level Four lockdown period, campus-based academic activity will not resume at Universities and TVET Colleges. Only final year medical students, will return under strict conditions, to also directly assist with the health management campaign of the Department of Health.
Nzimande said: It is not possible to determine with any measure of certainty the dates when physical return to campuses can happen. The risks of a return to normal campus-based activity for thousands of students and staff are simply too great and cannot function successfully outside of the national context of a general lockdown. Universities and TVET Colleges do not operate in a vacuum, but in a historically-specific context.” He added: “Whatever we do in the PSET sector, our responsibility is to lower the infection curve. We must save the 2020 academic year, but not at the expense of lives. Our efforts to save the academic year must avoid worsening the infection curve.”   
Nzimande explained that the period from 1 May until South Africa transitions into a lower Covid-19 risk phase, will be used to put critical interventions in place across the PSET system. “Our intention is to use this phase for preparation at all our Universities and TVET Colleges. Our collective efforts during this period remain that of putting appropriate remote learning support systems in place for all our PSET institutions, whilst preparing our institutional capacities for eventual return of students and staff once conditions permit.” said Nzimande 
This includes:
    •   Developing and implementing effective multi-modal remote learning; systems (digital, analogue and physical delivery of learning materials); 
    •   Securing a universal access deal with the major Mobile Network Operators around data and connectivity to support remote learning; 
    •   To provide students with instructional materials where needed;
    •   Finalizing the procurement and distribution of laptops for students;
    •   Securing possible relief funding to public institutions in distress;
    •   Ensuring equitable economic transformation that will ensure the advancement of the economic position of women, youth and persons with disabilities; 
    •   Prepare all PSET campuses with deep cleaning to ensure readiness for eventual return of students and staff, and employing SMME’s and cooperatives for that;
    •   Forging strong partnerships with the Departments of Health and Basic Education to coordinate efforts to successfully and safely implement the 2020 academic year and phasing in of the 2021 academic year;
    •   When students return to campuses, protocols will be in place for the maintenance of physical distance, access to hand sanitisers and protective masks, and deep cleaning of facilities;
    •   Reopening will entail the 3600 screening/testing of staff and students, with environmental cleaning of campuses and residences; Nzimande said that NSFAS funding for all students will continue. He urged students who have not as yet utilized their allowance to use their allowances to purchase appropriate electronic learning devices. The 2020 academic year will be re-organised to enable institutions and their students to complete academic requirements, with the prospects of extending into early 2021. The completion of the academic year 2020 and the start of academic year 2021 will be aligned with the Department of Basic education. For the Technical and Vocational Education and Training sector, the 2020 Academic Year will also be restructured in line with the continuity of the lockdown under Level Four (4) national protocols. Radio and TV broadcasts have already begun in key subjects, and are in the process of being expanded, and will continue for 6 months. The use of textbooks, e-Guides, past question papers, and uploaded YouTube videos, are strongly advocated and supported through bulk sms-es from colleges and WhatsApp groups set up by lecturers and is available on the Department of Higher Education and Training website.  
To recoup the number of days lost during lockdown, the number of College holidays will be reduced for June and September 2020.
