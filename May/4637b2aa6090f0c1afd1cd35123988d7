Additional planning to cope with the spread of the Coronavirus in Durban has led to the Durban Exhibition Centre cited as a field hospital following the tabling of a report at an online Municipality Executive Committee meeting, on Tuesday (26 May). The Durban Exhibition Centre is situated directly opposite the Durban ICC and is jointly managed. Municipal spokesperson, Msawakhe Mayisela said that the tabled report stated a need to plan for the spread of the coronavirus including the need for additional hospital beds. “It states that health authorities have reviewed the current bed capacity and have concluded that the availability may become insufficient should the crisis develop on a scale as seen in Europe and the United States over the past few months.” He explained that while the health authorities have already commissioned the phased recruitment of additional public and private hospitals to deal with the Covid-19 anticipated surge, the authorities have further concluded that there is a need to have a temporary field hospital, which will serve as a solution to provide additional beds to cater for surge capacity to assist and cope with the Covid-19 crisis. Field hospitals will serve to isolate patients with mild to moderate Covid-19 infections from their families and communities. The field hospital will also provide ICU facilities. “The report states that the Department of Health concluded after investigating possible locations, that the Durban Exhibition Centre is best positioned to serve that purpose. This is because it will require less building work and it can accommodate a number of beds. The report notes that the Department of Health have committed to restoring the facility to its original condition at the end of the period as well as to undertake deep cleaning including sanitisation,” said Mayisela.
