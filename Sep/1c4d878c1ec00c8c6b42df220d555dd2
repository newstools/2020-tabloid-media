The eThekwini Municipality has confirmed that land has been identified and graves older than 10 years will soon be exhumed in order to address the shortage of burial space within the city. The shortage of burial space within the city had left the municipality and the bereaved in a precarious position, as eThekwini was running out of gravesites with an estimated 5 000 remaining by the end of last year. Head of parks, recreation and culture Thembinkosi Ngcobo said that this predicament was resolved by the municipality in re-landscaping Loon Road Cemeteries, freeing about 8 000 graves sites. He said: “Land has been identified specifically for burial space, specialists are currently busy with environmental impact assessment and geotechnical assessment to ascertain if the land is suitable for graveyards.” The municipality has around 65 cemeteries and 97 percent of them at full capacity, as well, close to two third of them no longer operational. Ngcobo said that this had posed a huge challenge for the city and as such, there was an urgent need to come up with other burial alternatives. “This process means we exhume human remains in all gravesites that are 10 years and older, take them and rebury them at a smaller scale cemetery where they will remain permanently,” he said. Ngcobo said that the municipality instituted this method, which it felt appropriate to make way for new grave sites. “Through this, families who want to visit the gravesides of their loved ones will be able to do so. They will have full control over the grave spaces, and be able to perform appropriate funeral ritual,” he said.Ngcobo said that this action was necessitated by the high demand of burial space. To further meet this need, the city is developing a 30-year plan for provision of burial services.
