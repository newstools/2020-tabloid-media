Farmers from Ladysmith and surrounding areas will be participating in the peaceful march with over 500 vehicles forming a motorcade. The demonstrations are part of a countrywide protest to be held in various towns and cities such as Johannesburg, Cradock, Rustenburg, Pretoria, East London, Cape Town and Heidelberg. “Courage is contagious. When a brave man takes a stand, the spines of others are stiffened, a quote by Billy Graham and one that I never thought would come alive among our local and farming community of Ladysmith and its surrounding areas,” said Trevor Elrick. Elrick will be leading a peaceful motorcade protest against farm attacks, calling for justice for farm murders. “I can tell you, I’m not getting much sleep and the peaceful protest has taken on a life of its own,” said Elrick. Elrick told the Ladysmith Herald, that farmers from across the district as far as Van Reenen will be coming down to show their support in the motorcade, which will commence at 7am on Saturday along the Bluebank Road. “It’s been non-stop communication as farmers and farm workers have been confirming their commitment to the peaceful march,” said Elrick. He said that after the increase in farm murders and crime in general it has given him the courage to take a stand. “We are all responsible for the way things are in South Africa and a stand must be made.” Elrick said that not only is the protest against farm murders, but for everyone that has been affected by the increase in crime. “I’m not politically affiliated with any political party, we just want to create awareness and make a difference in our community,” he added. Elrick is calling on everyone in Ladysmith to be at the motorcade. He urged all organisations to participate and make a difference. For more information contact Elrick on 071 355 1596.
