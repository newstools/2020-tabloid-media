Phoenix police are probing a murder case after a man believed to be in his 20s was found deceased on the N2 north bound under the uMhlanga bridge, on Saturday afternoon. Communications officer at Phoenix SAPS, Captain Louise Naidoo said that the deceased was found with a wound above his left eye and left shoulder. “His right wrist and leg were fractured. It is alleged that the victim was robbed on the bridge and either jumped or was thrown down the bridge. His bag strap was on him but the bag was missing. Earphones were found on the scene but the cellphone was missing,” said Naidoo. Phoenix Community Police Forum (CPF) chairperson Umesh Singh said: “We urge community members to walk in groups or find safer routes for travel. There are lurking predators waiting to pounce on unsuspecting victims. These perpetrators are ruthless and will not think twice about taking a life for criminal gain.”
