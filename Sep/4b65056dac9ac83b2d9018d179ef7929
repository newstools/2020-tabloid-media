A knife-wielding suspect was arrested and his accomplice is at large after the duo held up a man on Westham Drive, recently. “The complainant alleged that at 5.40am he was walking on Westham Drive when he was approached by two men armed with knives. One of them came from behind and the other male approached the complainant from the front,” said Phoenix SAPS communications office, Captain Naidoo. She said that the suspects asked for a cellphone and the complainant informed them he had no cellphone. “One of the suspects tried to stab the complainant with a knife and the other one pulled out his cellphone from his pocket. “The complainant managed to grab the knife from one of the suspects and it fell. The suspect picked it up and stabbed the complainant above the shoulder. The complainant then ran to the taxi and the suspects ran off with his cellphone to the bush. A case of robbery was registered for investigation and one suspect was later arrested and charged,” Naidoo said.
