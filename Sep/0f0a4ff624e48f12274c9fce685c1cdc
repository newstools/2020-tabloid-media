 Ashwin Rampookar, a donor at the centre, told Tongaat and Verulam Tabloid that the ceremony was used as a prayer for peace and prosperity at the centre. Rampookar bought the fruits for the prayer and a big cake to celebrate the residents who are born in September. The centre is currently not allowing patients to visit their families to keep everyone safe from the novel coronavirus. He called on the public and the business sector to donate to the centre, which is providing essential care to the community. The centre caters for the needs of about 70 old and frail citizens in the area. Rampookar said: “The centre is in need of more donors to keep the facility afloat.” He expressed his gratitude to the centre management for allowing him to hold the ceremony.
He said: “I thank the centre management for allowing me to do all of this in honour of the patients.” Fathima Khan-Harripershad, centre manager, said that Covid-19 safety measures were followed during the prayer ceremony. “We are grateful for the prayer and birthday celebration. Being a non-profit organisation (NPO), we manage with limited resources and funding,” she said.
