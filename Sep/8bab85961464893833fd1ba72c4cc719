It is alleged that the victim was walking to work at 5.30am when she was accosted by the suspects. Captain Henry Kisten, Verulam police spokesperson, confirmed the incident. He said: “We are currently investigating the rape case. Suspects are still at large.” Prem Balram of Reaction Unit South Africa (Rusa), said that they received a call from the victim’s place of employment after she arrived at work and reported the rape. “We were told by the victim that one suspect drew a knife and placed it on her back while his accomplice stole her cellphone and wallet. The victim said that one of the robbers suggested to his accomplice that they rape her due to her being young and pretty,” he said. Balram said that the suspects then took turns in raping the victim on the side of the road. He added: “Both suspects were wearing face masks and baseball caps to hide their identities. They fled the scene on foot. The victim then returned to her residence where she changed her clothing and proceeded to her place of employment where she reported the incident.”
