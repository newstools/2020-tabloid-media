Criminals were on the prowl on Friday morning and struck on Brookdale Drive where they hijacked a motorist at gunpoint and drove off in an Opel Corsa bakkie. Phoenix SAPS communications officer Captain Louise Naidoo said that Phoenix SAPS officer, Seagent Thevraj responded to a complaint of carjacking whereby the victim was deprived of his vehicle, white Opel Corsa bakkie.“The victim alleged that two men, one armed with a firearm, approached him while he was seated in the driver’s seat. He was searched and questioned if the vehicle had a tracking device to which the victim replied in the negative. The victim’s father and helper were offloading the rear of the bakkie when the incident occurred.” “The suspects were dressed in blue overalls. The vehicle headed towards Cardham Drive. No shots were fired and the suspects are unknown at this stage. Police are investigating a carjacking case,” said Naidoo. Phoenix Community Police Forum chairman Umesh Singh urged community members to be on guard always and remain vigilant when behind the wheel. “These marauding suspects are on the prowl. They are looking to pounce on unsuspecting victims and cause mayhem wherever they get a chance. Motorists are urged not to resist these thugs who can be ruthless and in the blink of an eye take a life or cause irrevocable harm. Report suspicious persons or strange vehicles to your security service provider or the police for quick investigation and intervention,” Singh said.
