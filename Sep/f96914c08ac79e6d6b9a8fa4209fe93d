Police are probing a horrific double murder which claimed the lives of a 40-year-old mother and her 23-year-old niece. The Nkumbane, Malengeni, double murder was witnessed by the five-year-old daughter of the 40-year-old victim, leaving her traumatised and in shock. Scottburgh SAPS communications officer, Captain Adam Francis, said that the woman and her niece were shot and killed at around 7pm on 2 September. “Neighbours heard gunshots in the area but were unable to detect the precise location of the gun fire. The five-year-old witness ran to her neighbours and reported the shooting of her mother and her cousin,” Francis said. On their arrival, the neighbours discovered that both the females were shot and a one-month-old baby crying in the house. “The five-year-old and the baby were unharmed. Both the women succumbed to their injuries on the scene. An autopsy will be conducted at the Medico Legal Mortuary at Park Rynie,” Francis added. He appealed for anyone with information to come forward. You can contact Detective Warrant Officer Steyn Moonsamy of Umzinto Detective Services on 039 974 6500 or Crime Stop on 08600 10111.
