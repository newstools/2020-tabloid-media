A Verulam woman is counting her loses after she was allegedly defrauded by a consultant of a network service provider out of a total amount of R2 250. It is alleged that the victim received a phone call from a cellphone network provider consultant who wanted to assist her to block someones’s number. The fake consultant told the victim that the perpetrator wanted to do a sim-swap on her sim-card. Captain Henry Kisten, Verulam SAPS spokesperson, said that the suspect then asked the victim to provide him with her four digit security pin code, which she did, unknowingly granting access to the suspect. “A few minutes later the victim realised that she did not have any network on her phone. The victim contacted her network service provider and she was informed that her number was ported most probably by a con artist,” Kisten said. The victim thereafter went to make a withdrawal at her bank and she was informed that an amount of R2 250 was withdrawn from her account. Kisten said that they are receiving numerous reports whereby victims are being scammed with this kind of modus operandi. “We urge the public to be on the lookout for scammers that can mislead them into giving away their personal information. The public should refrain from giving away personal information to anyone especially those saying that they are consultants for different cellphone companies or banking institutions,” Kisten added. A case of fraud is being investigated by Verulam SAPS. Kisten said: “We would like warn the public not to purchase sim-cards from people selling on the streets. Those sim-cards can be fake.”
