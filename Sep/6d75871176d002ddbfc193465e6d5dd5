Two armed suspects were shot and injured, during a shootout with the Ladysmith K9 unit on Illing road on Thursday. Police told the Ladysmith Herald, that a group of armed men robbed one business and was in the process of robbing a second, when the suspects spotted patrolling K9 units. It is alleged that four men had been involved in the robbery. One of the businesses had a substantial amount of money stolen and the cashier was beaten by the group of armed men. The manager of the second shop was in the process of opening the safe, when suspects spotted the police and fled. While chasing down two of the suspects, the armed robbers opened fire on the police. The police returned fire injuring two. Businesses in and around Illing road welcomed the arrests of the men and said that businesses are falling victim to armed robberies daily. “Nearly every day, you will hear about shops being held up and robbed and we are grateful to have seen the police move in so quickly,” said the businessman. The two suspects were treated by KZNEMS and stabilized before being taken to hospital. The suspects will be placed under police guard at the hospital. Forensic teams and police closed off Illing road and the taxi rank. Charges of armed robbery and attempted murder are being investigated by police.
