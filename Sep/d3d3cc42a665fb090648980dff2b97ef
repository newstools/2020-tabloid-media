EThekwini Municipality mayor, Mxolisi Kaunda, has called for the audit on Covid-19 expenses to be fast tracked. Last Tuesday, 25 August, during the municipal executive council meeting, a report showed that the city had spent R427 million on Covid-19 related expenses between late March and 3 July.The Covid-19 social relief plan worth R66 million that was launched in KwaNyuswa will also be audited.The plan saw 1000 households in each of the 110 wards having access to staple and nutritious food during the lockdown. Kaunda said they may not have reached everyone because of a huge number of disadvantaged residents, but without any fear of contradiction they made a huge dent to poverty alleviation.“We are very proud of making a difference. It is therefore of paramount importance that we commence with thorough auditing. Anyone that would be found by this process to have short-changed the poor, would definitely face the full might of the law,” he said. Kaunda revealed that the city had allocated close to R600 million to respond to Covid-19 related initiatives.He said: “Working with our councillors, we identified 1000 households in each ward that are extremely needy. A list with ID numbers was compiled where each beneficiary, after receiving their food hampers and vouchers, signed as evidence that they received what was due to them. This helped us to prevent fraudulent activities.”Kaunda said that it was important to note that the expenditure did not exceed the allocated budget.
