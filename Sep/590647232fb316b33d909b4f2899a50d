Law enforcement agencies in Verulam ended Women’s Month in style by embarking on a placard demonstration in support of the fight against gender-based violence (GBV). The awareness campaign saw members from Verulam SAPS, Metro Police and Road Transport Inspectorate (RTI) educating residents on reporting incidents in Canelands, Cornubia Mall and the Verulam CBD. The silent protest comes after women have recently been subjected to heinous and violent acts of abuse in all parts of the country.President Cyril Ramaphosa recently described the GBV as second pandemic in the country. Captain Henry Kisten, Verulam police corporate communications officer, said that the demonstration followed all Covid-19 safety regulations including hand sanitising, the wearing of masks and ensuring a safe social distance. “Residents were advised to speak out and report any abuse incident. The pamphlets with regards to the GBV issues were read and distributed to residents,” he said.
