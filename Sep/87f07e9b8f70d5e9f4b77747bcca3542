An Umkomaas pet owner is facing criminal charges after his dog bit a 25-year-old man. Captain Adam Francis, Scottburgh SAPS communications officer, said that the accused, who is facing two counts, recently appeared before the Scottburgh Magistrates Court. He said: “It was alleged that the 25-year-old victim was attacked by a dog which belonged to the accused on 18 April at Crowder’s Farm in Umkomaas. The accused is facing charges of assault with intention to do grievous bodily harm and keeping of ferocious dog. The case has been remanded to October.” The accused last made an appearance in court on 18 September. The session was also attended by members of the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF), who stood in solidarity with the victim in calling for justice to be served against the dog owner. Francis said: “The court saw a gathering of around 120 EFF members who showed their support towards the dog bite victim. The docket is being investigated by Detective Constable Sihle Shonga of Umkomaas Detective Services.”
