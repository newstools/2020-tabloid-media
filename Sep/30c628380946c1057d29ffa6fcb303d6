The Crossmoor community are in shock after five-year-old Amahle Jojisa of Raffia Road informal settlement was electrocuted after stepping onto a live wire, on Sunday afternoon, 20 September. Amahle was on her normal weekend routine of playing with her friends in the area, when she stepped onto a live wire and grabbed onto a fence to which the live wire was connected to. Her uncle, Andiswa ran to her rescue, carried her in his arms and took her home. Paramedics attended the scene, however Amahle was pronounced dead on arrival. Mother of the deceased, Bawelile described Amahle as a happy go lucky child who had a bubbly personality. “My family and I are struggling to come to terms with the untimely death of our baby girl. Amahle brought to us joy and happiness and her death has left a void in our lives,” she said. DA councillor, Kanagie Pillay has visited the family to assist with funeral arrangements. “Amahle has been killed due to illegal connections. This is something our community has been facing for a long time where illegal connections are endangering many lives. Sadly, innocent Amahle had to fall prey to this major problem. The questions of illegal connections were raised in council and one child’s death is enough. Service delivery should suffice as promised,” said Pillay. The family has no income and is struggling to make funeral arrangements. Pinetown Funeral Services is assisting in providing a coffin while Pastor Ethan Ramkur of Survival Centre is assisting with burial fees. The community is encouraged to assist the family with the transportation of Amahle to her ancestral land in Harding. If anyone is willing to assist the family in cash or kind, they should contact Councillor Kanagie Pillay on 083 976 3089.
