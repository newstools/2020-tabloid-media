The mood outside the Newcastle Magistrates court was sombre as a group of supporters calling for farmers safety gathered at the gates since early this morning (Monday, 28 September). Meanwhile, inside the court Siyabonga Goodman Macu, 29, appeared before the magistrate for the alleged murder of Glen and Vida Rafferty who were gunned down in their Normandien home last month. The words of Johnny Clegg “We are The Scatterlings of Africa.” echoed through the streets and into the entrance of the court as music was used to get the demonstrators message across, as they waited for the bail hearing of the accused to get underway. The accused was denied bail and was remanded in custody until 29 October pending further investigation. The court is awaiting outstanding ballistic evidence as the investigation continues. “I am glad that the accused has been remanded in custody. We are here today not only showing support for farm murders but also for all the crime that goes unnoticed in our country. We are here to support change and to live out the words of our national anthem which is God Bless Africa. We need the blessings of God. Racial tension is at an all time high and we need to get rid of this. We are not a racist community but rather a justice seeking community,” said one of the supporters.
