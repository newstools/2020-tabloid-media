Quick intervention saved a 49-year-old man from ending his life after he attempted suicide on Friday following his Covid-19 recovery and discharge from hospital. Members of Reaction Unit South Africa (Rusa) were called out to Lenham Drive in Westham, Phoenix, after the man was found bleeding from lacerations to his left arm. According to Rusa head, Prem Balram, the man was discharged from Addington Hospital where he spent 14 days after testing positive for Covid-19. “On arrival at the residence, the man explained that after his adoptive parents passed away he ended up homeless. Two weeks ago he tested positive for Covid-19 and was admitted to Addington Hospital. After being released on Friday, he decided to end his life and slit his forearm with a blade,” Balram added.
There was an outpouring of empathy for the man when Rusa shared the story on their Facebook page. The public identified with his vulnerable frame of mind and empathised with his circumstances of grief and hopelessness.”Shew we forget how good we’ve got it until we’re reminded by stories like these. Poor guy. (Sic) Reaction Unit South Africa I’d be happy to make a donation of some sort to this gentleman to make his life abit more comfortable in the short term,” a social media comment read. (sic) A second post said: “If Rusa wants some sort of donation to help this man out with even a Wendy house, I’m willing to give something to start the initiative. Praying is good but what good will it do if we stand and pray and leave them in their predicament.” (Sic) Balram said: “It is incredible to note the spirit of humanity in such a situation. Most of the people responded with compassion and concern. It is distressing that an individual can feel so hopeless and alone in the midst of a crisis where suicide is sought as an escape.”
