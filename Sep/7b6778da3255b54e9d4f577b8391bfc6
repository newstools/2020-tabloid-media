The Department of Transport has clarified some uncertainties surrounding various licence renewals and expiry deadlines. This comes after the department announced a grace period for the validity and renewal of drivers’ licences earlier this year. The grace period was a result of the effects imposed by the nationwide lockdown, preventing some individuals from renewing their expired licences. Directions previously published by the department gave three specific deadlines set. Motor vehicles licence discs, temporary permits and roadworthy certificates, which expired between 26 March and 31 May, were deemed to be valid up until 31 August. Learner’s licences, driver’s licence cards, temporary driving licences and professional driving permits, which expired between26 March and 31 August, will be deemed as valid for the period ending 31 January 2021. Motor trade number licences, which expired between 26 March and 31 May, will be deemed as valid until 30 November. “Itmust be taken into account that no further extensions will be granted and those who fail to renew on time will have to pay the applicable penalties or face the necessary repercussions for late renewal,” said the department.
