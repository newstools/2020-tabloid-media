The Amanzimtoti-based crisis centre, Operation Bobbi Bear, is appealing for help. This follows the recent break-in and ransacking of the centre, that deals with abused children. The non-profit organisation provides a safe haven for sexually abused children in KwaZulu-Natal as well as much needed counselling. Their premises were broken into with the perpetrators taking everything from tea supplies to children’s rape bags and their extra clothes. The suspect even went as far as to taunt the staff by leaving only one litre of milk with a written message saying ‘only 1,’ that is left. Eureka Olivier from Operation Bobbi Bear thanked everyone who has responded to the organisation’s appeal for assistance. Olivier said: “Our work is done within all our communities and we cover a huge area. We pack various bags for our rape victims and always keep second hand clothes and shoes since whatever clothing a victim had on during the rape is bagged for forensics. Once again, thank you to our wonderful community for the care and support always.” The organisation said that while financial donations are always welcome, their ‘wish list’ consists of any items a child may need. “All victims only arrive with what they are wearing. Their clothes are sent to forensics so any good second hand clothes, shoes, linen and towels are welcome,” the organisation said. Together with those basic necessities, other required items are food, sanitary pads, toothbrushes and toothpaste, soap, deodorant for both for teenage boys and girls, plasters, basic medical stock such as Dettol or Savlon, bandages, anti-bacterial cream such as Bactroban and nappies in all sizes for the abandoned babies that they rescue. They also require baby toiletries and cleaning materials for the safe house.
