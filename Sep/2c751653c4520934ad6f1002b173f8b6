The Unemployment Insurance Fund (UIF) has extended the processing of new Temporary Employee / Employer Relief Scheme (TERS) benefit claims for April to September. This comes after consultations were held with social partners at the National Economic Development and Labour Council (Nedlac) The extension means that the Covid-19 TERS benefit applications for March to May will close on 25 September, applications for June will close on 15 October, while applications for July to 15 September will close on 30 October. The Employment and Labour Department said that no further applications for that period will be accepted beyond that date. “The closing dates will not affect claims that have already been submitted, as they will be processed and paid once the outstanding information is finally submitted to the fund,” said the department. The department confirmed that currently, payments are still on hold as the fund is working with the Home Affairs department and other government databases to verify about five million identity documents of Covid-19 TERS applications. “This is done to ensure that payments are made to deserving and authentic workers,” said the department. The Department is expected to make an announcement in due course about when the fund will resume with payments again. UIF Acting Commissioner Marsha Bronkhorst said that they are aware of the negative impact this delay has caused and is causing. Bronkhorst said: “In the interests of mitigating the risks which have been identified both by our risk unit and the Auditor General, we unfortunately have to pause payments. As soon as we have a sense of comfort with the steps taken, we will announce to the country the resumption of payments.”
