A robbery victim turned the tables on an alleged armed robbery suspect and acted in self defence when he stabbed the perpetrator who then fled from an ambulance with a knife sticking from the side of his face, in Phoenix recently. Members of KZN VIP Response and tactical teams were alerted to the incident by paramedics who advised that while travelling and transporting the armed robbery suspect to hospital, he had managed to escape in the direction of Rydalvale from the Phoenix Industrial Park. Spokesperson for KZN VIP, Gareth Naidoo said that the armed robbery suspect attempted to rob an individual but the victim fought back and acted in self-defence injuring the suspect. “The suspect had managed to evade arrest for over two hours in the dense bush area with the knife stuck in the side of his face. The suspect was later apprehended by KZN VIP and handed over to SAPS,” Naidoo said. He said that two members of KZN VIP were injured during the arrest as the suspect had dug up holes in the dense bush in an attempt to slow down the response team. “KZN VIP medics also responded to the scene and treated the injured officers before transporting them to hospital for further medical attention,” Naidoo added.
