Verulam police are investigating a case of rape after a 13-year-old girl was allegedly repeatedly raped by two men, recently. The victim was walking on the road, near her home, with a man that she had met on social media when they were confronted by the second suspect who held them up at knifepoint. She was taken to a secluded area where both the men took turns raping her.
Captain Henry Kisten, Verulam SAPS spokesperson, said that the victim was chatting with an unknown person on social media for some time and he sent a message asking to meet outside her home, which she agreed to. “The victim met this person and he asked her to walk with him up the road so that no one could see them. While walking they were approached by a man who was armed with a knife and he was known to the victim’s friend,” he said. The suspect threatened to stab both of them if they screamed for help. “The man then raped the teenager. The victim’s friend, whom she had been chatting with, also then raped her,” Kisten said. He warned against meeting strangers from social media. “We would once again like to warn the public when they meet someone on social media they should not agree to meet that person without knowing their background,” Kisten said. He added that they have a number of rape cases reported where the victims, especially women, were chatting with men whereby they agreed to meet with the pretext of providing employment only to learn the victim was either raped or robbed and other serious crimes committed by the perpetrator on the victim.
