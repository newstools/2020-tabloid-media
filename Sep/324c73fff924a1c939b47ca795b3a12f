A Batonmore pensioner,72,was beaten and bound after reaching out to a conniving job seeker who turned rogue on her in a bid to fulfil his criminal ploy, recently. Phoenix SAPS communications  officer Captain L Naidoo said that the complainant alleged that she gave the man an opportunity to do some gardening. “At 3pm, she went out to check on the said male but she could not find him. She then went back inside the house through the lounge gate which she had left open and she found the said male inside the house. The suspect grabbed the complainant and started to demand money and valuables. He then took her to the bathroom where he opened the taps and dragged her to the bedroom where he started to punch her. The suspect further tied the complainant’s legs and hands with scarves and pulled her 18ct gold ring from her finger,”Naidoo said.Naidoo said that the suspect also ransacked the bedroom and fled thereafter. “The complainant managed to call her neighbour for help. At this stage it is unknown what else was taken. The complainant sustained lacerations on her mouth,” added Naidoo.KZN VIP medics and response personnel responded to the scene. Spokesperson, Gareth Naidoo said: “The pensioner was stabilised by VIP medics before she was transported to hospital for further medical attention. SAPS and Sector 4 CPF members were on scene.”Phoenix Community Police Forum (CPF) chairman, Umesh Singh said: “We constantly urge residents to beware of hiring persons without reference checks and off the streets. This is a dangerous practice and has proven to frequently have detrimental consequences. Sadly, being a compassionate person in this day and age can cost you your life. Please refrain from hiring persons without checking their work references. It is a heinous crime to attack a defenceless pensioner.”
