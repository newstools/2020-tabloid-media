Alpine Road was abuzz on Friday morning as the Orange Mask campaign, co-ordinated throughout the country by the Active Citizens Movement (ACM), led a peaceful demonstration for one hour demanding an end to the coronavirus (Covid-19) corruption. Leading the demonstration, Raj Badal said: “We want people every Friday, to wear an orange mask and demonstrate against the corruption that is occurring in our country. “R500 billion has been allocated by the government towards the Covid-19 relief and a lot of the money has been looted. The money could have been used to build hospitals, and provide housing and education for our people. We want to raise awareness. “Our people are being deprived of the basic necessities of life because there are people in power who are looting. We want our people to protest against this. We want the corruption to end.” Badal said that the orange mask is a symbol of prison and by the demonstrations held, they want those involved in corruption to know that they will be serving jail time. “If these demonstrations held across the country do not stop the corruption, then we will be taking action and we want Shamila Batohi, National Director of Prosecutions (NDPP) to prosecute all the people who have been involved in corruption. We want her to send them to jail,” said Badal. Another demonstrator, Jabulani Mtshali said: “Today we are fighting against corruption and
I hope that people will see the message and join to support us in saying no to corruption.” Badal said that demonstration’s will be held every Friday across Durban and across the country.
