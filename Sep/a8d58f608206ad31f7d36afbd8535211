Panicked suspects who were lurking on Caneside Drive left their accomplice behind and fled when they spotted police and security personnel who were attending to an unrelated matter, recently. KZN VIP spokesperson, Gareth Naidoo said that the KZN VIP command centre received a distress call of a suspicious vehicle on Caneside Drive. “On their arrival, they were met by male foreigners in a vehicle. They were questioned and a passing police vehicle was stopped and assisted KZN VIP members. “A group of about four men who were walking on the road noticed KZN VIP and Durban SAPS K9 Unit members and panicked. They quickly boarded a maroon Toyota Camry and fled. One of the suspects was left behind and he was apprehended and searched. An unlicensed firearm with the serial number filed off was recovered. The suspect was immediately arrested and taken to Phoenix police station for further investigation,” Naidoo said.
