The birth of the Prophet (peace be upon him) was celebrated during the annual 16th juloos (procession) that was hosted by the Darul Uloom Qadria Ghareeb Nawaaz. The Ladysmith celebrations were among the many others that were held across KwaZulu-Natal. The juloos started at the Durul Uloom in Lahore Road. “This is a joyous time for all of us and we are all here to commemorate the birth,” said one of the marchers. This year, the Meelad-Un-Nabi celebrations as it is known was more momentous in light of French president Emmanuel Macron’s criticism of Islam and the publishing of caricatures of the Prophet. Late last month, the cartoons were projected onto government buildings in France, and, earlier Macron described Islam as a religion “in crisis” worldwide and vowed to present a bill in December to strengthen a law that officially separated church and state in France.
