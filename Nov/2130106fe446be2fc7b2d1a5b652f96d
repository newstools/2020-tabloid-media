A suspect met with a painful end when his alleged intention to rob a food delivery bike driver backfired, leaving him assaulted and fatally stabbed at the intersection of Chris Hani Road and Siphosethu Road, on Thursday. The deceased suspect, aged 27, was identified. Captain L Naidoo, Phoenix SAPS communications officer said: “It is alleged that the suspect produced a knife and attempted to rob an unknown motorist on a white food delivery bike. A white taxi with an unknown registration was passing by and stopped to assist the driver of the motor bike. Four unknown men alighted from the taxi and started to assault the suspect. The driver of the bike then approached the deceased and using the deceased’s knife, stabbed him once on the left upper part of the back.” She said that the men from the taxi and the driver of the bike fled the scene. “The assaulted and stabbed suspect proceeded to walk towards a fuel station. A witness managed to alert VIP medics who were at the fuel station to attend to the stabbed suspect. Upon paramedics examining him, it was established that he had succumbed to his injuries. The suspects are unknown at this stage and no arrests were made,” Naidoo said. A murder investigation is underway, according to the police. Umesh Singh, Phoenix CPF chairman said: “The community is fed up with crime. However, we do not condone vigilantism. The community is urged to hand over apprehended suspects to the police. Let the law take its course.”
