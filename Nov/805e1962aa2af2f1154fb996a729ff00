Police in KwaZulu-Natal are working hard on establishing the motive behind the attempted murder of iNkosi in Mehlomnyama, Port Shepstone. Colonel Thembeka Mbele, provincial police spokesperson, said that the arrest of a 29-year-old man, who is a relative of the victim, will help shed light on the assassination attempt. She said that the suspect was arrested while he was at his home and taken to the Mehlomnyama police station for detention. The murder attempt happened on 1 November at around 6.30pm inside a local tavern in Oshabeni, Mehlomnyama. Mbele said: “While the victim was inside the rest room, he was shot at twice by a known suspect and he sustained a gunshot wound to the face. He was immediately rushed to a local clinic and later transferred to hospital for medical attention.” A case of attempted murder was opened at the Mehlomnyama police station for further investigation. “The motive of the attack is yet to be established,” Mbele said. The accused is due to appear at the Port Shepstone Magistrate’s Court soon, facing charges of attempted murder.
