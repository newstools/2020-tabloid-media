The management of the Chatsworth Centre are fuelled and fired up to receive their eager customers who are waiting to pounce on the amazing Black Friday deals offered at the mall.

The centre management said that they are ready and that Covid-19 safety protocols are in place. Plans have been made to regulate crowd control with sanitisation stations in place. The management said: “This Black Friday, our staff will be fully equipped to cater to the community while keeping all Covid-19 safety protocols in place. We are ready for a jam-packed Black Friday, full of deals and eager to serve our customers.” Wearing a mask is mandatory.
