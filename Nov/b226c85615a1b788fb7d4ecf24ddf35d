EThekwini residents living in the South of Durban will be affected by an interruption of water supply in some areas in the South Region from 10 November from 5pm to 11 November at 6am. This is due to a planned shutdown by the Municipality’s Water and Sanitation Unit of the South Coast Augmentation pipeline to replace a faulty scour valve and a leaking air valve on the 800mm diameter steel trunk main, supplying Amanzimtoti waterworks. In a statement issued by the municipality on Monday, 9 November, spokesperson Msawakhe Mayisela said: ” The process will commence on 10 November from 5pm to 11 November at 6am. During this process, there will be zero incoming flow and thus downstream areas including eThekwini reservoirs and Amanzimtoti works will have limited system input volume.” Mayisela said the following areas might experience poor pressure or no water towards latter times of the shutdown period, amid the construction: Amanzimtoti CBD, Isipingo, Athlone Park, Doonside, Warner Beach, Winklespruit, Karridene, KwaMakhutha, Most parts of Adams Mission, Ezimbokodweni, Lewis Dr area, Malabar Hills, Lotus Park, Garden lots, Almond Road, Bhekulwandle, Umnini, Magabheni, Danganya, Craigieburn, Umkhomazi, Clanstal, Naidoville, Willow Glen, Midnight Café, Crowder, Ehlanzeni, Mgobhozini, Illovu, Lovu Beach, Mfume, Mashiwane, Egudwini, Nkwali, Kingsburgh, Panorama Park, Umgababa, KwaFakazi, KwaMgendwa, Mahlathini, Ohlongeni, EKuphileni, Amahlongwa, Amalundi The municipality apologised for any inconvenience caused during this period, and urged residents to use water sparingly.
