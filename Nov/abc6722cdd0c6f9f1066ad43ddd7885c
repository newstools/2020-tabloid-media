A Brookdale grandmother had her thali ripped from her neck by an armed robber when a gang of four gun-wielding suspects stormed the family’s home on Wednesday night. The complainant, her husband, cousin and grandson were seated in the lounge of their Guardsbrook residence when the terror ordeal commenced. Captain Louise Naidoo, Phoenix SAPS communications officer said: “One male pulled off the complainant’s Hindu holy chain (thali) from around her neck. At this stage another two men entered the premises. One man stayed in the lounge with the complainant and her family while the other three ransacked the rest of the house.” She said that the neighbour activated their alarm which disturbed the suspects, causing them to flee the premises. “Upon fleeing, the suspects took a cellphone which belonged to the complainant’s grandson. The suspects fled in a silver Mercedes of which the registration is unknown. It was established that there were two other men that were seated in the vehicle while the other four suspects were on the premises,” Naidoo said. The total value of items taken was R6 000. A house robbery case is under investigation, according to Naidoo. Umesh Singh, Phoenix Community Police Forum (CPF) chairman said: “Criminals continue to run rampant in our community. Families are living in fear. We urge residents to ensure security measures are in place at their homes and businesses. Doors, gates and windows must be secured. Be vigilant. In this day and age with a high crime rate, residents cannot be lax with security. If held up by armed suspects, do not antagonise them as they can be ruthless and snuff out a life with no remorse.”
