Two suspects who were arrested for carjacking and attempted murder made their first appearance in the Durban Magistrate Court on Friday, 13 November. The suspects aged 32 and 34 were arrested by the Greenwood Park SAPS after a carjacking incident that took place on Kenneth Kaunda Road in Durban North on 11 November. According to Jerome Slater, communications officer for the Greenwood Parks SAPS, a female victim was parking her white Mercedes Benz when two unknown males approached from behind demanding her vehicle keys. “The victim fearing for her life and shocked at what was happening, decided to flee but was chased by one of the suspects and threatened with a firearm to hand over the keys. The victim did as instructed and they fled with her vehicle,” Slater said. He said that local security officers were also informed and followed up giving chase towards North Coast Road heading towards KwaMashu. Slater said that while on chase, the suspects failed to control the vehicle leading it to overturn. “Abandoning the Mercedes and desperately needing to get away from the police, the suspects then carjacked a maroon Mazda 3. Inspector D.S Ogle from Metro Police service together with Marshall Security officers who were hot on the heels of the suspects effectively brought them to a standstill on North Coast Road and apprehended the two suspects,” he said. A 9mm pistol with 11 rounds ammunition was recovered at the scene. “A case of carjacking and attempted murder was registered and the detectives are still investigating and profiling the suspects. The suspects remain in custody,” added Slater.
