Swift reaction from a Blue Security area manager resulted in a stolen vehicle being successfully located less than an hour after suspects fled the Morningside area with it, on Tuesday. “All Blue Security units were on the alert and intensified patrols after information regarding the stolen vehicle was circulated by the tracking company,” said Andreas Mathios, community and media liaison officer of Blue Security. Various security service providers had been notified of the missing vehicle and the intense search included a helicopter flying over the area. “Even though the vehicle’s signage had been removed by the suspects to prevent it being identified whilst in transit, Blue Security’s area manager was still successful in locating the bakkie about five kilometres from where it had been stolen,” Mathios added. He said that as soon as he spotted the abandoned vehicle in Sydenham, the area manager contacted the tracking company supervisor and informed him of the recovery. “The tracking company’s helicopter also flew over the crime scene and,using GPS triangulation technology, affirmed that the area manager had indeed recovered the correct vehicle. The suspects had already fled by the time the area manager approached the abandoned vehicle and notified the various parties concerned. “SAPS, the tracking company, various other responders and a relieved owner arrived at the scene a short while later,” added Mathios. Investigations are continuing.
