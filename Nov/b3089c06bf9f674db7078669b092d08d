According to the United Nations Women, violence against women and children has increased during the coronavirus pandemic. Support groups have said that due to the lockdown more women have been staying at home and are therefore in constant presence of their abusers. Women in abusive relationships may feel they have little to look forward to this festive season. To draw attention to the scourge of violence against women and children, the Umbilo Community Police Forum, private security companies and the Umbilo SAPS kicked off the 16 Days of Activism for No Violence against Women and Children campaign on 25 November. The campaign started as a motorcade through the different sectors of Umbilo where members held up placards and banners to make the community aware that gender-based violence is a human rights violation and should be reported. Heather Roos, the community policing chairperson said: “Today we wanted to raise awareness by getting the community to realise that gender-based violence is happening in our community. We need to stop looking the other way and actively get involved in reporting crime and abuse and taking a stand to say enough is enough.”
The motorcade targeted busy districts in Umbilo such as residential and business areas, as well as schools and public parks. Roos said the motorcade was to bring maximum attention to those who are abused and those who are abusive. “My message to those who are abusing women and children is to stop. We are not going to look the other way. If you are a victim you can break the silence. You need to say enough is enough,” said Roos. Warrant Officer Nosipo Mthembu said: “To the men who are abusing women you need to stop. Gender-based violence will not be tolerated and we hope this motorcade has brought attention to the community to report gender-based violence. Those who are victims should not suffer in silence.”
