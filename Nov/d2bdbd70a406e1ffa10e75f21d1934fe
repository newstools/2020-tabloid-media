A mother and daughter suffered a traumatic ordeal when they were confronted, attacked and robbed by an armed suspect who pounced on the duo after their vehicle broke down on the N2 southbound in the vicinity of the Spaghetti Junction interchange, on Thursday, 29 October. A PT Alarms Tactical Unit officer was passing and immediately stopped to assist when he saw the commotion which resulted in a woman being robbed of her handbag and stabbed by the perpetrator who fled the scene. Trishen Govender, spokesperson for PT Alarms said that a motorist saw what unfolded and stopped to assist. “He bravely pursued the suspect who fled and disappeared. There was a lot of activity at the time. “I stopped and quickly approached the victims. I immediately summoned PT Ambulance Service and attempted to pacify the mother and daughter. Upon arrival of PT paramedics, they treated the victim on scene. The woman, an educator, and her daughter, were visibly shaken,” Govender said. According to Govender, the injured teacher could not identify the sharp object wielded by the suspect that led to her injury. The victim and her daughter, who is a matric pupil, graciously thanked all who assisted them during their awful encounter.
