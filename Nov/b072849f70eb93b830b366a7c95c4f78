A retail storm is brewing as shoppers in the north coast of Durban are expected to queue for Black Friday deals while others have opted to shop online. On Friday, 27 November, many cash-trapped residents will be looking to capitalise on the welcomed specials and pre-Christmas deals over the period. Amid Covid-19 fears, online retailers can expect a bumper sales period on the big day as shoppers avoid retail stores and shopping malls. This represents a massive opportunity for online sellers in South Africa to step up and deliver to a market which, until the surge in Covid-19 online-spending, was sitting at just 1.4 percent of total retail sales in 2018, according to World Wide Worx’s Online Retail in South Africa 2019 study. Although the novel coronavirus pandemic has caused havoc on the entire year’s big ceremonies and festivals, the management of Checkmart Supermarket in Tongaat, said that they are ready for the big day. The management said that all Covid-19 safety protocols will be followed. “Our staff will be prepared with required personal protective equipment (PPE). We have many deals and we are ready to serve our community,” the store said. Meanwhile, the South African government has urged the public to buy local in order the revive the economy. In his recent address when he delivered his National Recovery Plan, President Cyril Ramaphosa made a call for increased localisation as a means of kickstarting the economy again. Ramaphosa said: “Bearing in mind the number of jobs that have been lost and the many livelihoods still at stake, we are urging consumers who are planning to take advantage of the 27 November sale, to buy locally manufactured goods. By buying local we retain and may even re-create some of the jobs that have been shed over the last few months and put South Africa and South Africans back to work. This is the message to South Africans by both the real and the fictitious President of the country.”
