The suspension of embattled Ugu municipal manager (MM) has made way for the return of former acting head, Sibusiso Sithole. The former eThekwini city manager and Passenger Rail Agency of South Africa (PRASA) CEO, will take over the temporary reigns from suspended Dhanpalan ‘DD’ Naidoo, as of 23 November. Sithole is no stranger to the district as he was appointed the acting MM, in March, while Naidoo was out of action. France Zama, municipal spokesperson, said that the decision to appoint Sithole was taken at a special council meeting convened on 23 November. He said: “This decision by the council was taken after careful consideration of the representations made by DD Naidoo after he was recently served with a notice of an intention to suspend.” Naidoo was asked by the council to give reasons as to why he should not be suspended, after he was implicated in a scathing forensic investigation report by the Department of Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs (Cogta). The report cited poor governance, maladministration and the misuse of municipal funds as the reasons behind poor service delivery and ailing infrastructure within the municipality. Zama said the suspension of Naidoo serves as part of the “protracted measures being undertaken by the municipality to diligently process all the matters contained in the Section 106 report.” He said: “The municipality is conscious of the fact that such matters it is currently dealing with may invoke public interest and raise anxiety levels among interested parties. Municipal leadership is carefully instituting all due processes in dealing with the matters contained in the report and therefore request for tolerance and calm during this period.” Sithole is the go to guy for Cogta, as he was also appointed to head up troubled uMsunduzi Municipality, following it’s collapse last year. He joined Ugu briefly following his stint in Pietermaritzburg.
