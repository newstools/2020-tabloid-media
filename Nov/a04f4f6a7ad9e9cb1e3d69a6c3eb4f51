Dhiya Domun, Mahima Domun, Yudaika Dhathadeen and Yeshna Dhathadeen prepare to celebrate Diwali on Saturday, 14 November. Diwali, also known as the Festival of Lights, celebrated during the Hindi lunisolar month Kartika, between mid-October and mid-November, is one of the most popular festivals that symbolises the spiritual victory of light over darkness, good over evil and knowledge over ignorance. On the day of Diwali, devotees worship Mahalakshmi, the goddess of wealth and prosperity. The editor and staff of the Ladysmith Herald join our advertisers in wishing all Hindus peace, safety and a blessed Diwali/Deepavali.
