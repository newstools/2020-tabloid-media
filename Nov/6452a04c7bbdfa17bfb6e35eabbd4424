The November Safety Month campaign which will run until the end of the festive season in KwaZulu-Natal is in full swing following its massive launch in Umzumbe, last week. The campaign was launched on 3 November by the MEC for Transport, Community Safety and Liaison, Bheki Ntuli, Ugu mayor Sizwe Ngcobo and SAPS provincial commissioner Lieutenant General Khombinkosi Jula among other officials. Ntuli said that this multi-pronged crime fighting programme is aimed at reducing major crimes in the province ahead of the festive season. He said: “Today is demonstration of strength and commitment by our government to protect its people. All our enforcement agencies are here and this is the approach we are going to use from now going to the festive season period. We want to build a safe province and it is possible if we all work together.” One of the main aims of the campaign is to highlight the fight against gender-based violence and other contact crimes. During the launch at Sibanini Sports Ground, under Umzumbe Local Municipality, Ntuli also announced key interventions that are aimed at tackling crime hotspots areas, following the resolutions of the recent provincial executive council (PEC) which was convened to deal with the crime situation in the province. He said: “We unleashing all resources we have, capital, personnel, equipment and all other forms to the fight against crime. Our people must live and feel safe in the communities. Our priority will be the crime hotspots areas and those leading stations are receiving maximum attention. Murder, attempted murder, robbery, gender-based violence are some of the key areas of focus.” Ntuli said the November Safety Month campaign which seeks to galvanise all sectors of society to actively participate in the fight against crime and social ills.
