One of the most important holidays on the Hindu calendar is Diwali, the annual Festival of Lights where Hindus around the world celebrate new beginnings and the triumph of good over evil and light over darkness. The beautiful and colorful festival is celebrated with gift exchanges, fireworks display and festive meals. Fereshna Ramsoochit is one of many Hindus who will be celebrating Diwali on 14 November. “I am looking forward to celebrating the festival with my family. It has been a notably challenging year so this is going to bring some cheer to each household. Even though celebrations will be slightly different this year I will not let it dampen the mood,” said Ramsoochit. From the colourful temples of Thailand to the historic synagogues of Israel, cultures around the world celebrate light in one form or another. Whether it’s releasing lanterns into the sky or lighting candles each night, such occasions are a time to practice togetherness, kindness, compassion and gratitude. Speaking to the Newcastle Express, Pundit Suresh Singh of Jagrati Nauyuwak Sangh and spiritual head of Awakeness of the Youth Association said “Diwali is a time not only for praying and sharing gifts but a time to awaken ones consciousness and understanding ones constitutional position in this material world. It is especially a time to consider how we can rise from darkness to light and to impart knowledge and wisdom to others.” The Newcastle Express would like to wish all our Hindu readers a blessed Diwali.
