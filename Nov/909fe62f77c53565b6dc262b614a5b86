A Sastri Park resident awakened on Thursday morning to find bullet heads on his property and discovered that his home had been fired at with damage to the roof and kitchen. The Metro Park resident heard the gunfire but was unaware at the time that his property was targeted. The man contacted Reaction Unit South Africa (Rusa) at approximately 10.01pm after he found at least six bullet holes on the roof. Prem Balram, Rusa head said that the property is situated below road level. “Two bullet heads were recovered in the kitchen. One had broken a mirror while the second bullet penetrated a milk carton. “According to the man, multiple shots were heard during the early parts of the morning, however, he only realised that they were directed at his home after he woke up and discovered the bullet holes. The motive for the shooting is unknown at this stage,” Balram said. Captain Louise Naidoo, Phoenix SAPS communications officer confirmed the incident and said a case of malicious damage to property is under investigation.
