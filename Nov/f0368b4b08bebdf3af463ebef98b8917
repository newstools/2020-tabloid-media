A pair of Port Shepstone pharmacy assistants will embark on their first steps towards their 350km journey from Port Edward to Richards Bay in an effort to address food insecurity during the Covid-19 pandemic. Yaseen Bux, 34, and Zusakhe Nangu, 35, will commence their walk on 2 November and conclude on 6 November and are aiming to raise R500 000 with a crowd funding campaign. The campaign, launched on BackaBuddy, will be utilised to purchase much-needed food parcels for vulnerable families who have lost their jobs during lockdown. Bux said that with the profound negative impact that the pandemic has had on the economy, many people across industries have lost their jobs and livelihoods. He said: “Many of these people, who were the breadwinners for their respective households, cannot put food on the table and are having difficulty securing employment.” Since the launch of the campaign, almost R6 000 has already been raised in anticipation of the event, which will be donated directly to the Gift of the Givers. Bux said: “The proceeds from our campaign will be directed to the Gift of the Givers Foundation to purchase the food parcels which will be given to communities that are in dire need of relief. Please support us in making a life-changing difference in the lives of these people by contributing to our BackaBuddy campaign.” To support Bux and Nangu’s campaign visit https://www.backabuddy.co.za/walking-against-hunger.
