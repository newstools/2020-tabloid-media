Durban Family Violence, Child Protection and Sexual Offences Investigations Unit and Point SAPS are appealing to the community to assist in locating two men pictured in the identikit as they may be linked to two rape incidents which occurred during the month of October. “It is alleged that on 3 October, a 26-year-old victim visited her friend’s place at Marine Flats in Durban where they consumed alcohol with two males, one of them is foreign and unknown to the victim. The victim alleges that she was heavily intoxicated and decided to go sleep in one of the rooms. She alleges that while she was sleeping someone entered the room and started touching her intimately. After touching her, the person then raped her,” said Captain Muzi Maphumulo Durban Central SAPS communications officer. He said that upon investigation, the FCS Unit was informed that the suspects name is Osman (Identikit one) and are now appealing for assistance in finding him.

The white Quantum with registration 4336 occupied by the driver and a passenger drove with the victim to Inanda area where she was allegedly forced into a cottage and was raped by both men,” said Maphumulo.
