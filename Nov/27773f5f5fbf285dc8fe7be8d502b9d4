A Bolt taxi driver claims he was held up at gunpoint by three passengers on Eastbury Drive, on Wednesday evening. The driver claims he was robbed of cash and cellphones, locked in the boot of his vehicle and dropped off at an unknown location. Captain L Naidoo, Phoenix SAPS communications officer said: “It is alleged by the complainant, a driver for Bolt taxies that he was traveling on Eastbury Drive, driving a silver-grey Toyota Corolla with three male passengers when the passenger at the rear pointed a firearm to his head and asked him to continue driving. “It was somewhere in Ntuzuma where the driver was ordered to stop and the passenger armed with a knife in front forced him out of the vehicle and put him in the boot of the car. The complainant alleges that he was dropped off a while later at an unknown location. He was robbed of two cellphones and R900 in cash.” Naidoo said that the complainant was transported to Phoenix SAPS by an Ntuzuma SAPS vehicle at about 10pm where a case was registered. The vehicle was recovered at Inanda area by Trio Crime members at 9.40pm.
