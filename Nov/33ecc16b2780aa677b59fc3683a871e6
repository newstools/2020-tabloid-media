In his address to the nation on Wednesday 11 November, President Cyril Ramaphosa called for five days of national mourning from 25 to 29 November for lives lost due to the Covid-19 pandemic and gender-based violence (GBV). Ramaphosa highlighted the upcoming 16 days of activism campaign against GBV. He has on many occasions referred to GBV as the second pandemic as many South Africans lose their lives to the scourge of GBV. “It will be appropriate that during the 16 days of activism for no violence against women and children, which is the second pandemic that we are facing, we demonstrate our remembrance of all those who have departed due to the Covid-19 pandemic and GBV,” said the president. The national flag will fly at half-mast from 6am until 6pm on 25 to 29 November and citizens are encouraged to wear a black arm-band or other signs of mourning to show solidarity. “Many of us have had to bid farewell to a loved one, a friend, or a colleague. As we look back on a year of much sorrow, it is important as a nation that we should honour and remember all those who have succumbed to this disease,” stated Ramaphosa. Newcastle resident, Christopher Copwell said that he welcomed this gesture. “I have lost two family members during this time. One is my mother’s sister who lived in the UK for many years, we were unable to say our goodbyes and the other is a colleague of mine whom I have worked with for close to 12 years. This is a way for us to grieve as a nation and pay our respects not only to those who have lost their lives but also to all the healthcare workers in this town who have put themselves at risk in order to help save the lives of those who have been affected by Covid and to the SAPS who attend to the calls of GBV. We salute you,” he said. Newcastle youth joined in solidarity by wearing black and paying homage to those who have lost their lives to Covid-19 and gender-based violence.
