The pupils of Fairyland Day and Aftercare who were all dressed up in their colourful attire were excited for their pre-Diwali celebrations this week. The pupils coloured in lamps and also dressed in their cultural outfits in celebration of the much-awaited festival of lights. Diwali which will be celebrated on Saturday, 14 November, is one of the most popular festivals of Hinduism world-wide. The festival symbolises the spiritual victory of light over darkness, good over evil and knowledge over ignorance. The festival is widely associated with Lakshmi, goddess of prosperity and with the age-old story of Ram and Sita. On this auspicious day, many Hinduâ€™s start their day off with an oil bath and often wear new clothes to distribute sweet baked goods to friends and family. Tabloid Newspapers wishes all our readers of the Hindu faith a safe, holy and fun Diwali.
