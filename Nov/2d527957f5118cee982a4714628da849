Tragedy struck the small community of Driefontein, after a 12-year-old boy drowned while swimming with a group of school friends on Wednesday afternoon, 18 November. Driefontein is situated about 20 kilometers outside of Ladysmith. Community, friends and family were notified and rushed to the water filled hole. KZNEMS, Ladysmith SAPS and K9 Search and Rescue were called out, after friends told the community that the 12-year-old had slipped under the water and did not come up. “We were trying to find a way to cool down,” said one of the youngsters. The area was pointed out to W/O Jacques Meyer from the K9 Search and Rescue, who waded into the water. The surface of the water is misleading and a few steps into the water filled hole, it drops down to about three meters deep.  W/O Meyer made a few free dives down and on the fourth dive managed to locate the body of the 12-year-old. Friends and family that had gathered nearby watched in shock and horror as the young boy’s lifeless body was placed on the edge of the water. “This is heartbreaking and I can’t believe what we have just witnessed,” said a bystander. The 12-year-old has not yet been officially identified. Ladysmith Police has opened an inquest. Police have issued a stern warning to the community to be careful and not allow children to swim in water filled holes.  With rain predicted for the next few days, communities are asked to stay away from overflowing rivers and areas that have been filled with water.
