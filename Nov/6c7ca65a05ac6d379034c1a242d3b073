Service providers and job seekers are increasingly falling prey to scammers requesting cash upfront for securing Covid-19 related tenders and general employment, warns Transnet Port Terminals (TPT). While social media platforms have previously been used throughout the year to advertise false opportunities, the intensity this year is at an all-time high, says TPT. Mbali Mathenjwa, TPT Corporate Affairs Executive Manager, said: “We will keep appealing to the public not to part with their hard earned cash. No legitimate Transnet opportunity will ever require cash upfront”. Mathenjwa said that verifying all opportunities on the official company website and that of the National Treasury was a sure way to establish whether the adverts were valid or not. Last year, TPT launched its annual nationwide #PhansiNgoTsotsiAwayWithCriminals campaign tipping members of the public on how to spot job scams. “We would like to thank the public for the information they have been sharing with us and for calling our offices when not sure of advertised opportunities,” said Mathenjwa. She said daily, TPT averages about seven calls from victims desperate to get their money back from criminals who have vanished. At this time, it is often too late and the information required by investigators to help them is often not available or outdated. “To determine whether adverts are real or fake, there are three main red flags. The first one is that a Transnet email address ends with a dot net (.net). No cell phone numbers are ever shared by recruiters and supply chain management personnel. No money is ever required from interested individuals” said Mathenjwa. The public are urged to use the anonymous tip offs line 0800 003 056 especially when they see a friend or family member fall for the scam. Providing details like cell phone numbers and names of the criminal, receipts and proofs of payment as well as date and venue of arranged meetings will go a long way in helping with the arrest of criminals.
