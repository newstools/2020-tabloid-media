A daring escape by an alleged house robber proved to be fruitless when he was apprehend after taking a two-storey jump in Yellowwood Park, which left him with serious injuries. Andreas Mathios, Blue Security community and media liaison officer, said that the incident happened last Saturday when the housebreaker was caught in the act crawling on the floor of the family home. After being spotted, he panicked and jumped from the second storey of a residence in Yellowwood Park, sustaining injuries. Mathios said: “The suspect was apprehended by one of our armed-response officers, assisted by a unit from another security provider. The trespasser was crawling on the ground after injuring his leg, sustained from jumping from the upstairs bathroom window.” He said the intruder was spotted inside the house by the homeowner, who quickly raised the alarm. “His (homeowner’s) warning shouts to the trespasser, on spotting him, caused the intruder to make a hasty exit through an upstairs toilet window. The suspect was injured in the fall and apprehended by the armed-response officers when found crawling in the yard,” Mathios said. It is alleged that the suspect accessed the property by jumping over the wall. He then climbed up the outside of the building via the water pipe, forced open the toilet window on the upper level, and gained entry. Blue Security reported that nothing was taken during the incident and only the toilet window was damaged when it was forced open. “SAPS Montclair attended the scene and took the suspect into custody for further processing,” Mathios said.
