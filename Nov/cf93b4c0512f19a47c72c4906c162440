“The State Against Mandela and the Others is a reminder, that all great things that happen in this world, are achieved collectively.” – French film co-director Gilles Porte. As South Africa dipped its rainbow flag at half-mast as a poignant tribute to 20 000 citizens, compatriots, comrades and colleagues who have lost their lives to the deadly coronavirus plague, let us remember the pantheon of pioneering leaders who contributed collectively to our democracy. Among the legends from the thousands of all-race, anti-apartheid activists – at home and abroad – are Ahmed Mohamed Kathrada. His political trial for treason, alongside the iconic freedom fighter Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela and the others are immortalised in a brilliant foreign-made film. Kathy, the only Indian among the ten accused of attempting to overthrow the apartheid government, and were charged in the historic Rivonia Treason Trial, was born to Indian immigrant parents in the far-right Afrikaner town of Schweizer-Reneke on 21 August 1929. He died on 29 March 2017 – aged 86 – and did not live to see a documentary film in which he contributed to when it was released in film festivals in Durban and Cannes.
In The State Against Mandela and the Others, the lenses were focused on the nine co-accused in the landmark legal battle, but it also highlights only Mandela’s dramatic words from the dock. In true-blue French liberte (equality) tradition and the cinema verite – an art of documentary style of film-making – combining of improvisation and the use of camera to unearthed truth or information hidden from reality – the documentary brings to life a court drama that captured the world. As a gift to a free SA’s institutional memory, the film could be described as a pièce de résistance: the narration, historical facts and drama encapsulates a powerful story – thanks to the power of technological and re-engineering of the master copies of the actual audio recordings of the headline-grabbing trial played out in Pretoria’s Palais de Justice. Co-directors/producers Nicolas Champeaux and Gilles Porte, who reeled back 60 years from the apartheid archives, said of their “labour of love”
• “Although Mandela took centre stage during the historic trial, there were nine others who, like him, faced the death sentence and were subjected to pitiless cross-examinations.
• “The State Against Mandela and the Others is a reminder that all great things that happen in this world are achieved collectively.’’
• “The film transports audience back into the thick of the courtroom battles and attempts to redress the historic balance by putting Mandela’s comrades on the centre stage.”
• “The studio spliced the technology of animation and traditional interviews for the screenplay. With local support, our film crew arrived in South Africa and we conducted interviews with the treason trialists and their lawyers, including George Bizos,”
The movie-making duo reproduced an extensive and stunning clarity of the court recordings from a selection of 256 hours of the remastered material. They spliced with it with charcoal-style animation and real-life interviews of the surviving members of the trial – recalling each one’s role in a fascinating journey of of the quest for freedom and democracy. While SA celebrated uhuru, the producers were hard at their artistic, cinematic work, delivering a “high-style legal-drama fashioning of the facts’’ of the trial.
The ideologues were captured on celluloid – jovially celebrating their camaraderie and loyalty – to their collective mission to revolutionize a new country. The voices of Accused 1 – Nelson Mandela to Accused 10 – named as “the Others’’ – Walter Sisulu, Denis Goldberg, Govan Mbeki, Ahmed Kathrada, Lionel ‘’Rusty’’ Bernstein, Raymond Mhlaba, James Kantor, Elias Motsoaledi and Andrew Mlangeni, are heard in the retrieved archival material. Only 10 men faced the trial (9 October 1963-12 June 1964).
Charges were withdrawn against Bob Hepple. He fled SA without testifying against his comrades. The convicted saboteurs, apart from Goldberg and Bernstein, were flown and ferried to Robben Island in Cape Town. In a new film, Escape from Pretoria, Goldberg, is portrayed by actor Ian Hart, in the real-life prison break by two white ANC captives from the notorious prison into exile. He refused to escape without the release of his Robben Island leadership. Kathrada, Goldberg and Mlangeni and their lawyers contributed generously to this emotional and epic story-telling. Amidst the revolution and sabotage, Kathrada, described as an Indian-Muslim, spoke of his secret love affair with his white fiancée Sylvia Neame, and how their love-across-the-colour line liaison was under pressure in apartheid-era SA until Kathrada’s prison sentence ended the relationship. Neame’s reading of Kathrada’s final letter to her before his imprisonment on Robben Island is described as “quietly devastating, a reminder of the personal as well as the political cost of resistance’’. On his release 26 years later, Kathrada married fellow anti-apartheid activist Barbara Hogan. The Ahmed Kathrada Foundation, founded in 2008, is a living legacy of his generation of free-spirited proponents of human rights, social justice and non-racialism – as aptly narrated in the digitized version along with the original recordings of the court drama. Mandela’s lieutenants took different paths to joining the outlawed ANC and his campaign of radical armed resistance to the hardline, white-power regime as they recall with a sense of humor, sorrow, pathos and defiance, in which they also reflected the aspiration and the ideology of their fallen comrades who survived the pernicious penitentiary system. The accused knew that they faced the death penalty, and recalled in the film how they used the courtroom as a theatrical platform to expose the atrocities of apartheid to the world. Mandela’s exceptional sound bite – “an ideal for which I am prepared to die” speech lays the central theme for the film: “It is amazing how Mandela’s lawyer George Bizos got him to tweak the words of his statement that saved them from the gallows,’’ recalled Mikhail Pappas, film-goer and former broadcast journalism lecturer. Bizos influenced Mandela to alter the words about being “prepared to die’’ for his cause that would have annoyed the judge. Bizos, who died aged 92, during the height of the Covid-19 scourge, and championed human rights, attended the premiere two years ago. He recounted and regaled about his experience during the trial, and how his legal team of Joel Joffe, Bram Fischer and Arthur Chaskalson, had bravely defended the ANC leadership: ‘’I was overwhelmed to have seen the ‘’Others” – past and present – on the big screen.’’
Bizos shared with me and waxed lyrically with a deep sense nostalgia and déjà vu about his personal experiences with each of the ten accused men in the historic court drama that attracted diplomatic intervention – including the British government – to pressure the government not to hang the convicted men. The ANC’s Umkhonto we Sizwe (MK) detachment carried out a spate of sabotages and bombings on state infrastructure before a posse of hardline security policemen – acting on tip-offs and close surveillance of the Lilliesleaf farmhouse – stormed and raided the secret hideout and arrested 11 men on 11 July 1963. Winnie Madikizela-Mandela, remembered for her fiery comments to foreign correspondents and her raised clenched fist that cut a powerful image on the steps of the courthouse, gave her last interview before her death in 2018, aged 81.During the trial, right-wing ministers told the world press that capital punishment was a case of fait accompli for trialists who were charged by hawkish prosecutor, Percy Yutar, for “recruiting persons for training in the preparation and use of explosives and in guerrilla warfare for the purpose of violent revolution and committing acts of sabotage.’’ Lest we forget all these fallen heroes as our flag flies at half mast.
