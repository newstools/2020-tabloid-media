The Keep Hillcrest Beautiful Association (KHBA) is appealing to the public for donations to keep the organisation afloat. The organisation has been trying to revive their recycling centre after three months since they have re-opened after the lockdown. KHBA is a recycling centre that helps in keeping the area clean by recycling while teaching and raising awareness about recycling. Like most places, the centre has taken a hard knock since lockdown. Russell Winship, KHBA chairman said that if they do not get funding, they will have to let go of some of their staff members. “Our staff have been with us for 10 years, and the recycling will fall away if we lose them. The organisation is currently operating with insufficient funds, we only have five or so companies in Hillcrest who do about a R1000 per month, but we forsee trouble in January and February,” said Winship. He urged the public to pay their annual subscription and to go on their Facebook page: Keep Hillcrest Beautiful Association.
