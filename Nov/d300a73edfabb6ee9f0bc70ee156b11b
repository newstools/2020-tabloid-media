Extortion came under the spotlight at Phoenix SAPS after three police officers were arrested, charged and released on bail for crimes committed during lockdown. The detectives from the Provincial Anti-Corruption Unit continue with their operations to root-out rotten apples hiding behind the SAPS badge which led to the arrests.
Captain Nqobile Gwala, KwaZulu-Natal police spokesperson said that the operation yielded good results when they arrested a total of three police officers on 9 November for extortion. Warrant Officer Noranthan Baldav, 50, Constable Ntuthuko Vicent Ngcobo, 28 and Constable Innocent Makhiseni Xulu, 34 briefly appeared before the Verulam Magistrate’s Court on 9 November. They were each granted bail of R2, 000 and the matter was remanded to 15 January 2021. “Their arrest came after the complainant alleged that on the night of 12 June, the three police officers stationed at Phoenix arrived at his place of residence and accused him of selling cigarettes. They forced him to pay R3 000 and also took his cigarettes to the value of R14 000. All the three suspects were identified and placed under arrest,” Gwala. The KwaZulu-Natal provincial commissioner, Lieutenant General Khombinkosi Jula welcomed the arrest of the suspects. “We would like to warn all those who are involved in criminal activities that the law will take its course,” he said.
