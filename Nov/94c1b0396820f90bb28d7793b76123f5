EThekwini Municipality has issued a stern warning to Durban residents to refrain from illegal connections. According to the city, there has been recent reports of electricity transformers exploding in different parts of the city which in most cases is led by illegal connections. This subsequently leads to power cuts in those affected areas. Msawakhe Mayisela, spokesperson for eThekwini Municipality said that transformers can explode for various reasons including storms, due to a lightning strike, damage to wires or equipment in the electrical grid receiving too much electricity flow into the transformer, causing it to blow, however, the biggest concern is illegal connections. While illegal electricity connections are prevalent across the city, this is most common in areas around informal settlements. In informal settlements, you find that there are legitimate customers but if you look at the number of customers that are connected to one transformer, they comprise 30 percent of the overall connection, of which 70 percent of them are illegal, added Mayisela. He said that most of these transformers burn during peak hours because everyone is using electricity at the same time. â€œIllegal connections lead to transformer bursts and that places legitimate customers at a disadvantage which further creates misdirected anger towards eThekwini Electricity, Mayisela said.
