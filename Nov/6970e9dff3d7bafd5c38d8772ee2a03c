Mystery surrounds the murder of an unknown man who was found shot and lying on a property in Rydalvale on Thursday morning. Captain Louise Naidoo, Phoenix SAPS communications officer said that at approximately 2.30am, the owner of the premises claims that he was awakened by his dogs who barked incessantly. “He alleged he noticed a person groaning in his yard. He claims as he got to the person, the man passed on after bleeding from a wound on his chest. Three adult males from the premises were questioned and they all maintained that they were awakened by the screaming. Strangely enough no one heard the gunshot,” Naidoo said. She said that police members examined the crime scene and found a spent 9mm cartridge near the deceased. “The deceased is an unknown male aged about 25-years-old. No signs of any possible break in were detected at the premises. Prima residue tests were performed on all the adult male persons including the neighbour who is a prison warder,” said Naidoo. She said that the 9mm firearm was found at the neighbour’s house and seized as an exhibit. “Investigations into the murder are underway,” Naidoo added. “We urge residents to be careful with the use of firearms. The law is strict about firearm laws and we urge members of the public to abide by such laws. Police will investigate this matter and the perpetrator responsible for the shooting will be called into account as well as the circumstances surrounding the murder will be closely investigated,” said Phoenix.
