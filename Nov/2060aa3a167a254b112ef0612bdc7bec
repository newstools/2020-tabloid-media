A 16 year old Mozambican national is lucky to be alive after he slit his throat twice following an accusation of theft that was levelled against him by his Ethiopian store manager at a general dealer in Parkgate, Ottawa, on Thursday. Reaction Unit South Africa (Rusa) received a call at approximately 1.13 pm from the owner of the store requesting urgent medical attention for the teenager who was found bleeding excessively from his injuries. Prem Balram, Rusa head said that Reaction officers and medics were dispatched to the store in the vicinity of the Parkgate Taxi Rank and upon arrival found the male seated in a back room. “He was conscious but bleeding from two lacerations to his throat. Medics worked quickly to stabilise him before transporting him to hospital. The teenager claimed that he was assaulted with a bottle by his Ethiopian national store manager during an argument. He was then allegedly locked in a room. The boy also claimed that his manager threatened to kill him when their employer arrived. While waiting, he located a knife in the room and decided to take his own life,” Balram said. He added that the manager denied the assault or the threats made but informed Reaction officers that he caught the temporary worker stealing R200 from the business. According to the manager, he asked the boy to be seated in a back room until the owner of the store arrived. When they checked on him they found him bleeding and a kitchen knife was located next to him. Verulam SAPS are investigating further.
