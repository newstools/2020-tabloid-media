Serious claims have been made by the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) and the Mazibuko family from Besters in Ladysmith, after a 50-year-old mother and her three daughters briefly appeared in the Ladysmith Magistrate’s Court on 25 November, on charges of assault on the police, trespassing and intimidation. EFF members from Bergville, Estcourt and Ladysmith gathered outside the court, demanding that the woman and her daughters be released. The EFF members shouted racist slogans, including “kill the boer”. Police officers who kept a watchful eye over the picketing were targeted, as the group hurled insults at them. “We are here to show the court that the police are protecting the white farmer and these charges made are wrong,” said Khumbulani Langa, regional chairperson of the EFF. Speaking to the Ladysmith Herald, Mthokozisi Mazibuko, said that his mother and sisters are the victims and not the suspects. Mazibuko explained that his mother and three sisters had been living on the farmer’s property, when their home was demolished. “My mother wanted to find out the reason why her home was demolished and was met by police brutally.” Mazibuko also claimed that his sister was shot by the farmer. Ladysmith Police Captain Bongani Nathi said that there was no incident of a shooting reported. “The cases opened by police against the mother and her three daughters, ranges from assault on the police, trespassing as well as intimidation,” he said. Speaking to the Ladysmith Herald, police said that the Mazibuko family are staying on a farm in the Bester ‘s area. “The family and the farmer could not agree upon a new building on the property. They exchanged words and the owner of the farm opened a case with the police. The police were asked to help address the difficult situation.” said Nathi. The police and the family members failed to come to an agreement. It is alleged that the police were assaulted by the Mazibuko family. “Besters police are investigating,” said police.
