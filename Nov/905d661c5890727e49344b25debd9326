Chatsworth and neighbouring Marianhill have been named as two of the hotspots when it comes to murder in KwaZulu-Natal. Police Minister, Bheki Cele, also named Osizweni and Empangeni as the other two troubled areas in the province. Cele said this during his delivery of the quarterly crime statistics, on Friday. He also said that between July, August, and September there were 675 people killed in South Africa, 249 of those murders happened in KZN. According to the stats, Chatsworth accounts for 24 of those murders, an 84.6 percent increase from the same period in 2019/20 which saw 13 people being murdered within the township. Sexual offences increased by 11.8 percent, attempted murder went up by 42.1 percent, house robbery climbed to 6.2 percent while carjacking remained the same, with 16 incidences reported. Cele blamed the increase in trio crimes on alcohol. He said: “Over a thousand incidences of murder, attempted murder, rape and assault took place in or outside liquor outlets such as bars, taverns, shebeens and nightclubs. These figures make it impossible to deny the true effects of alcohol abuse.” Cele said that he was against the negative effect alcohol has on the communities. “This is despite my views being unpopular in some quarters of society. But these crime statistics continue to vindicate our actions as the police to clamp down on illegal alcohol trading,” he said. Overall murder declined by 339 in the country, sexual offences decreased by 16.8 percent. Cele said: “Despite this decline it was still a high number of people who were raped. The other thing that keeps on surprising us and we will work hard on it is gender-based violence (GBV).” He said they will work hard to clamp down on GBV cases because the numbers were unacceptable. Cele said that they need to rein in those behind these crimes.
He said that while many citizens are still working from home due to the Nationwide Lockdown, incidents of home invasions have increased by 8.5 percent.
