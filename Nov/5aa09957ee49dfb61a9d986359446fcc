Two suspects have been arrested for the murder of a foreign national. What began as an outing with his girlfriend turned into a fateful evening for a foreign national in the industrial area on the evening of 11 November. Lizzy Arumugam, SAPS Corporate Communications Officer said it is alleged that around 10pm, the foreign national together with his girlfriend, both 27, set out on foot from their rooms at Scrapo Metals to a tavern in Guttenburg Street about 200 metres away from their place of residence. “After buying their alcohol and making their way back to the rooms they were then approached by two males asking the couple for cigarettes. When they refused, one of the suspects pulled a knife. The girlfriend ran for her life and was pursued by the attacker. Her boyfriend was chased by the other man,” said Arumugam. She further added that while the victim was running towards his room, the suspect allegedly threw a beer bottle at him. The victim was found lying at the entrance of his room drenched in blood. According to ER 24 the victim was declared dead on the scene and had sustained an open wound to his stomach. Security personnel in the area found the jacket of the suspect on the scene. Both suspects were found hiding at a factory in Guttenberg Street and arrested. The suspects will appear before the Newcastle Magistrate’s Court.
