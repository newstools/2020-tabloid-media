 President Cyril Ramaphosa announced the extension of the National State of Disaster to 15 December 2020. The president addressed the nation on 11 November, on progress in the national effort to contain the coronavirus (Covid-19) pandemic. He advised on how to prevent a resurgence of infections, spoke on vaccine developments and economic recovery. Ramaphosa said that many are suffering from “coronavirus fatigue.” and have begun to forget that the coronavirus is still present. “More than 52 million people have been infected globally, and more than 1.2 million people have died. Many countries are in the midst of a second wave of infections, which has often been more severe than the first. Covid-19 is far from over. And it will remain with us for some time to come,” Ramaphosa said that many world leaders commended South Africa’s management of the pandemic. He said that we have endured “the worst of the storm” and under alert level 1 we can prevent resurgence with “no need to return to a higher alert level.” To date, South Africa’s confirmed coronavirus cases are 742,394 with 20 011 Covid-19 deaths. The recovery rate is 92 percent. Preventing a surge of infections
Ramaphosa reported that the Eastern Cape is showing signs of resurgence, with spikes in the Nelson Mandela Metro and the Sarah Baartman District, triggered by outbreaks in institutions of higher learning such as universities, schools and attendance by people at large gatherings combined with poor adherence to social distancing, mask wearing and poor hygiene measures. Higher than average rates of new infections are in areas such as Lejweleputswa and Mangaung in the Free State, Frances Baard and Pixley ka Seme in the Northern Cape, and the Garden Route and Cape Town metro in the Western Cape. Ramaphosa said that with people moving between provinces it is a matter of time before this surge spreads to other parts of the country however a resurgence plan developed with the World Health Organisation has been implemented. National State of Disaster extended
In extending the National State of Disaster to 15 December, Ramaphosa highlighted that we need to pay attention to the upcoming festive season, where people travel and also gather socially. “These activities, if not undertaken responsibly, pose the greatest immediate threat to our management of the pandemic. But we can avoid a second wave if we each play our part, if we remember what we need to do to keep ourselves and others safe. The coronavirus is transmitted in small particles from our nose and mouth when we talk, cough, sneeze or breathe heavily. A cloth mask, worn over the nose and mouth, is still one of our best defences,” said Ramaphosa. He said with the festive season approaching it is understandable that we will want to be with family and friends. “ It has been a stressful and traumatic year. We want to socialise and connect. But this doesn’t mean we should let our guard down.”
He called on everyone to download the Covid Alert SA mobile app. Vaccine
