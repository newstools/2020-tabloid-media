It was grisly scene that unfolded on the R102 at the Ottawa intersection where an unidentified man was killed after he was run over by two vehicles, recently. A passerby contacted the Reaction Unit South Africa (Rusa) operations centre reporting the body of a man lying on the road. Prem Balram, Rusa boss said that members were dispatched to the scene and on arrival found Verulam SAPS in attendance. He said the pedestrian was lying in the south bound lane. “He suffered life threatening injuries and died at the scene.According to a member of the public, the pedestrian was struck by a white unknown bakkie on the north bound lane. The bakkie sped off without stopping. The pedestrian suffered severe injuries but was seen attempting to crawl onto the north bound lane when he was run over by a second vehicle travelling in the opposite direction. That vehicle also drove off without stopping,” said Balram. He said that police are investigating further. “It is a low point in humanity when a driver rams into a person and flees without attempting to determine if the victim has been injured or killed. That quick check can determine whether the casualty lives or dies,” Balram added. He urged motorists to be vigilant and warned pedestrians to refrain from crossing busy roadways. “Accidents can happen in the blink of an eye and lives are irredeemably changed or lost forever,” Balram said.
