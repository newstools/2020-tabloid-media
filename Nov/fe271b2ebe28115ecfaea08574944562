Alfred Duma Municipality Mayor Cllr Vincent Madlala and a group of councilors joined seven members from the Hope for Africa Foundation, in their 620km walk challenge, this morning, (Friday, 20 November). “This is an initiative aimed to raise awareness about the lack of appropriate footwear for children in disadvantaged communities. This is an issue that has long existed in our society, where many children today, still walk to and from school with shoes in dire conditions or even worse, without any shoes at all,” said Jabulane Thabethe, CEO, Hope for Africa Foundation. The group started their challenge on 11 November at Katlehong, Johannesburg and will end in Durban. The walk has helped over 4500 children since it started in 2016. The Hope for Africa Foundation is a non profit organization and the members share a passion to uplift and empower the youth. “Our greatest goal is to break innate poverty cycles and the inequalities that exist through education, sport and recreation as well as skills development programs,” said Thabethe. Thabethe said the days have been long and hot, but the communities and municipalities including Ladysmith and its people have made the challenge worthwhile with every step made. This is the fourth challenge done by the members. “I would like to thank the brave men and women who participated in this challenge for their sacrifice made and for creating the awareness. We give them our support,” said Mayor Madlala.
