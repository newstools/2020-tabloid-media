Social media was abuzz as the search for missing Clare Estate resident, Vishnu Naidoo, 65, gained momentum from Friday but ended in tragedy when his body was discovered at a Durban beachfront apartment, on Sunday afternoon. Pleas for assistance to locate Naidoo were shared far and wide and private security company, Reaction Unit South Africa (Rusa), conducted an aerial search to speed up the process. It was alleged that Naidoo had plans to visit the Pavilion Shopping Centre and Springfield Park Makro but failed to return home. There were reports of Naidoo being spotted around Durban but none panned out. Reports further alleged that Naidoo’s cellphone was switched on but calls went unanswered. Colonel Thembeka Mbele, police spokesperson confirmed that Naidoo’s body had been found. “It is alleged that on 15 November at 3.30pm, a 65-year-old male was found dead at an apartment in OR Tambo (Parade).
