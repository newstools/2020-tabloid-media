The newly appointed acting Umdoni municipal manager, Sikhumbuzo Dludla, and chief financial officer (CFO), Ayanda Mthethwa, will have to hit the ground running in order to restore the finances and running of the municipality to its former standing. Mthethwa and Dludla were appointed following the sittings of the Umdoni Special Council, where the acting mayor, Sibongile Khathi, announced the strong stance taken to suspend with immediate effect the municipal manager, Dr Vuyiwe Tsako, on grounds of allegations of financial misconduct and maladministration. Tsako was asked by the municipality to give account on the allegations of her misconduct made in the report by the Department of Corporative Governance and Traditional Affairs (Cogta) and to give reasons on why she and former chief financial officer (CFO), Thandazile Mhlongo, should not be suspended. Khathi said that the council deliberated on the written submission by the troubled municipal manager, as the accounting officer of the municipality, and found her wanting. She said: “As the municipality we will wait for the Cogta investigation findings and thereafter a final decision will be reached by the municipality that favours the progressiveness of the municipality and the community it serves.” In regards to Mhlongo, Khathi said that during her tenure as the finance head of department she brought an enormous amount of expertise in this department, which were evident through the numerous positive audit outcomes under her leadership. “We thank her for her meaningful contributions towards growing Umdoni municipality,” Khathi said. Khathi further added that the municipality has faith that due diligence will be done on this matter aimed at ensuring transparency by the municipality while simultaneously ensuring that the Umdoni community’s developmental interests are catered for.
