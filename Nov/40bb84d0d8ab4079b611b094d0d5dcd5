Durban Solid Waste (DSW) workers are on a strike which has disrupted the collection of refuse removal. The city calls the strike illegal and is appealing to residents to keep their refuse in their yards until further notice. In a statement today (17 November), Ethekwini spokesperson Msawakhe Mayisela, said the leadership of the municipality will be meeting with the unions representing the workers to ascertain what their grievances are and speedily map the way forward. “The city’s leadership is prioritising this matter and is pulling all the stops to ensure that the situation returns to normalcy with speed,” Mayisela said. Ethekwini apologised to residents for the inconvenience the illegal strike is going to cause.
