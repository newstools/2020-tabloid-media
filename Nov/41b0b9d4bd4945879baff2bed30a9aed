Incidents of theft of cellular phones, wallets and valuables were made to the SAPS and a common approach is that the suspects are operating in a syndicate. Captain Adam Francis, Scottburgh SAPS communications officer, said that the scheme unfolds when one of the suspects approaches his innocent victim and initiates a ‘decent’ conversation. He said: “While his accomplices gather behind the victim without the victim’s knowledge. The suspect continues with his conversation and simultaneously reaches out to the victim by extending his hand to greet and even goes to the extent of touching the knees or legs of the victim. While all this is happening to the victim, the suspects behind the victim, removes items from the victim’s pockets within a flash and disappear amongst the crowd. The victims that were interviewed reported that they did not feel anything when items were removed from their pockets.” Francis urged the public to take note of this type of criminal activity and to always stay in a group. Police further reported that when persons are alone they must stay closer to other members of the public. “The bottom line is never to be distracted by unknown persons and never to entertain any form of conversation with strangers. Do not display your cellular phones and wallets,” Francis warned.
