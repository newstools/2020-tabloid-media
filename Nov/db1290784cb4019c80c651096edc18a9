The SAPS Corporate Communication: Newcastle has issued awareness tips for stokvel groupings and how to prepare for personal safety outside the home: Tips for stokvel groupings
Be careful. Criminals are targeting your stokvel payout this festive season. As the festive season approaches, residents are eager to spend their hard- earned money with their loved ones. Regrettably, this is also the time in which criminal elements will attempt to continue committing crimes. As a precautionary measure, SAPS Newcastle would like to caution the community, particularly those who have been saving money
through stokvel groupings or societies to avoid carrying a lot of cash. • Refrain from making cash deposits of club members contributions on high-risk days (e.g. Monday after month end).
• Ensure persons depositing club cash contributions or making withdrawals are accompanied by another club member.
• A stokvel savings or burial society can arrange for members to deposit cash directly into the club’s account instead of collecting cash contributions.
• Arrange for the club’s pay out to be electronically transferred into each club member’s personal account or accounts of their choice.
• Take another person with when going to deposit club cash contributions.
Personal safety tips
• Be aware of your surroundings at all times and trust your instincts. If you think you are in an area you should not be, you probably are.
• Know where you’re going and the safest way to get there, particularly when moving about the city during hours of darkness. Walk/run in well-traveled, well-lit areas avoiding short cuts through alleys and parking lots.
• Have a plan of action in mind. Decide where you would go and what you would do should some dangerous situation occur. Know where the nearest police station is located, how to contact the police in the event of an emergency, what establishments are open late where you could seek refuge if needed, etc.
• Walk with confidence on the street and at a good, steady pace. Keep your head up, observe your surroundings, and don’t look down at the ground.
• Carry a whistle or similar type of noisemaker. In the event of an emergency, the sound may scare off a would-be attacker.
• Take special care when jogging or biking. Vary your route, go with a friend, and avoid isolated areas.
• Do NOT wear headphones or listen to music.
These can distract you from being aware of your surroundings and who may be approaching you.
• Keep purses and packages tucked securely between your arms and body.
Don’t overload yourself with packages and bags it is distracting and it can make you look defenseless.
• Carry only what you need. Don’t carry a large amount of cash or numerous credit cards and avoid wearing flashy and excessive amounts of jewellery.
• Exercise caution when using ATM machines. Only use ATMs located in well lit, well trafficked areas those physically located in stores are the safest.
