The quick actions of SAPS members in Montclair have been praised following the arrest of two robbery suspects after a shootout with police on Tuesday night. Police officers from the Provincial Task Team were conducting their duties in Montclair when they were approached by a man who informed them that he had been robbed. Colonel Thembeka Mbele, provincial police spokesperson, said that the complainant informed the officers that he was walking along Kenyon Howden Road when he was robbed of his cellphone by five armed suspects who were travelling in a vehicle. “The police spotted the said vehicle on Robin Hood Road and they tried to intercept the vehicle. The suspects fired shots at the police officers and there was a shoot-out. The suspects abandoned their vehicle and fled on foot. Two suspects were arrested whilst the other three managed to evade police arrest,” Mbele said. A search of the suspects unearthed several cellphones including the one that was robbed from the complainant which was found inside the suspects’ vehicle. “A two-way radio that was used by the suspects was also found near the scene. Inside the boot of the vehicle, police found clothes and shoes suspected to be used by suspects after committing crimes,” Mbele said. She said that the investigation conducted at the scene revealed that the same vehicle was used during a house robbery committed in KwaMakhutha last month. “The suspects will also be profiled to check if they are linked to other robberies committed in the Umbumbulu and surrounding areas. The suspects believed to be 21 and 22 are expected to appear before the Durban Magistrate’s Court soon on charges ofrobbery and attempted murder of police officers,” added
Mbele. KwaZulu-Natal Provincial Commissioner, Lieutenant General Khombinkosi Jula welcomed the arrest of the suspects. He said: “We will continue with our positive approach in the fight against criminals in this province.”
