A vigilant nine day search led to the discovery of a missing teenager who was found dead recently. Captain Adam Francis, communications officer at Scottburgh SAPS, said that the body was found in the bushes at Mgayi in a decomposing state along with a firearm and a suicide note. “A missing person’s report of a 17- year old male was opened at Sawoti SAPS on 25 October this year. The police immediately followed up every lead to trace the missing person and the investigation was on-going. On Tuesday, 3 November the body of a 17-year-old was found in the bushes at Mgayi with a firearm and suicide note,” he said.
Francis confirmed that on that fateful day at around 11.30am, community members began a search for the missing male person and followed up the trail of a decomposing body odour. They found a decomposed body that fitted the description of the 17-year- old scholar. Captain Siva Pillay, Sawoti SAPS station commander, confirmed that a revolver and a suicide note was found next to the deceased and that an inquest is being investigated.
