Flags will be flying at half-mast from 25 November to 29 November to remember the victims of gender-based violence (GBV) and the lives lost as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic. South Africa reached and surpassed the 20 000 mark, of lives lost, on Wednesday. During his address, on the same evening, President Cyril Ramaphosa said that the country was dealing with two pandemics. He said: “We have lost many lives to this pandemic. Many of us have had to bid farewell to a loved one, a friend or a colleague. As we look back on a year of much pain and sorrow, it is important as a nation that we should honour and remember all those who have succumbed to this disease.” Ramaphosa also urged remembrance of all the women and children who have been killed in violent acts of GBV. “It will be appropriate that during the 16 Days of Activism for No Violence against Women and Children, which is the second pandemic we are confronting, we demonstrate our remembrance of all those who have departed due to the COVID-19 pandemic and gender-based violence. “Cabinet has decided that from the 25 to 29 November, the nation should embark on five days of mourning for the victims of Covid-19,” Ramaphosa said. The national flag fly will fly at half-mast throughout the country from 6am to 6pm. Ramaphosa said: “We call upon all South Africans to wear a black armband or other signs of mourning to signify our respect for those who have departed. We call upon all South Africans to demonstrate their solidarity and do this in remembrance of our countrymen and women, in recognition of the grief that we share as a nation, and as an affirmation of our determination to overcome this devastating disease.”
