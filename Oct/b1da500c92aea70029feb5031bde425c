The police members drove towards that direction and they found a man lying down on the side of the road at the corners of Ivenham and Quintham Place. The man, aged 25, was found with a stab wound on the left of his chest and scratches on his fore head. He was identified as Salesh Premlall,” Cpt Naidoo said. She added: “An ambulance was called to attend to the victim. He was declared deceased by paramedics. No arrests have been made. Investigations are ongoing.” Phoenix Community Police Forum (CPF) chairman, Umesh Singh, said: “Violence seems to be abounding in the Phoenix. Another family is plunged into mourning. This time criminals are responsible for this merciless and senseless killing. Community members are fed up with criminals invading their homes and properties. They want to protect themselves and their community but these callous criminals have no mercy.” “We as a community grieve with the family of the deceased who lost his life while trying to be proactive in the fight against crime. We pray justice will be served and those responsible for this heinous crime will be brought to book and punished accordingly.” According to the Reaction Unit South Africa  (RUSA) Facebook post reporting on the fatal stabbing, it stated that Premlall was employed at a call centre and was expected to marry his girlfriend early next year.
