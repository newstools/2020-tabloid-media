Masquerading as alleged protectors of the innocent, two men offered to walk a woman home safely, bought her a cider then pounced on her with one man raping her before robbing her of her wallet and cellphone in Verulam, on Sunday morning. The apparent good Samaritans allegedly approached the victim, 26, a Phoenix employee, who was waiting for public transport to go home to Canelands after she was dropped off on the R102. Reaction Unit South Africa (Rusa) was contacted by a resident to assist the victim after she sought assistance at an Amora Drive residence in Mountview. Rusa head, Prem Balram, said: “On arrival, the emotional victim informed Reaction Officers that she is employed at a soft drink company in Phoenix. She was dropped off on the R102 by a colleague after work and was waiting for public transport to get to her residence in Canelands when she was approached by two men. “The suspects informed the woman that the area was dangerous and offered to escort her home. While walking they convinced her to stop at a local bottle store on Moss Street. They bought her a cider which she consumed.” Balram said that the three then left and while walking towards Canelands they forced her into a bush where one of the men raped her. She was then robbed of her wallet and cellphone. “The suspects then informed her that they were not going to allow her to go back home and that she must follow them. While taking a short cut on Amora Drive, the victim screamed for help and the suspects ran off. The woman was transported to the SAPS to register a criminal case,” Balram added.
