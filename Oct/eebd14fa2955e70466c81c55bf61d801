Approximately 100 disgruntled former employees, armed with stones and traditional weapons, blocked off the main entrance to the Sumitomo Dunlop Tyres Operations plant and threatened employees, who reported for work on Thursday morning (22 October). Plant employees were not allowed to gain entrance to work, as protest action against Sumitomo Dunlop Tyres Operations plant heads into its third week. Violent outbursts from protestors have been reported. The former employees have been retrenched and are demanding their jobs back. “We will not leave until we have our jobs back,” said one of the protestors. Protestors also say that they will not settle for less pay. On Wednesday, employees had to leave the plant under police guard, as an angry mob threatened to throw stones at those leaving the premises. Extra security measures had to be in place. It is alleged that disgruntled former employees have been intimidating employees working at the plant, closing off Helpmekaar Road that passes the plant. Motorists had to stop and turn around as the group turned violent, on Wednesday afternoon. “They just start throwing stones,” said a motorist driving on the Helpmekaar Road. The plants management and unions are in talks but it seems no solutions are forthcoming to date.
