A breakthrough has been made in the double murder case of Normandien farm owners Glen and Vida Rafferty. Last night (Thursday, 15 October) detectives from the Provincial Organised Crime Unit arrested five suspects who were detained for questioning in connection with the murder. The suspects are in custody pending further investigation. “A vehicle suspected to be used in the commission of the crime was also seized as part of the ongoing probe,” said Brigadier Jay Naicker. The murder of the couple, who were shot multiple times in front of their home on 29 August has sparked outrage in the local farming community of Normandien and in Newcastle, leading to nationwide protests against farm murder. The other accused, Siyabonga Goodman Macu,29, will appear in court again on 29 October pending further investigation. The accused is remanded in custody.
