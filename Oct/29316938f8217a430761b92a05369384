In a bid to clamp down on Covid-19 infections, the eThekwini Municipality has launched a pilot project to streamline the booking process for driving license renewal at Verulam Driving License Test Centre. Msawakhe Mayisela, municipal spokesperson, said that the decision taken by the metro police management is aimed at preventing the spread of the Covid-19. He said that the risk of contracting the virus was increased by license holders queuing for long periods at the centre. Mayisela said: “The decision was taken in the best interest of the public safety.” The public is required to contact the booking office and make an appointment to renew their driver’s licenses. The number to call is 031 322 1771 and
031 322 1853. “The documents required when renewing your license include the original identity document (ID), ID copy, proof of residence and preferably an eye test certificate from an optician which approved in terms of regulation 102 of the National Road
Traffic Act 93/1996,” Mayisela said. The booking office is opened from Monday to Friday from 8.30am to 2.30pm, excluding public holidays. The centre operating hours are Monday to Saturday 7am to 2pm.
