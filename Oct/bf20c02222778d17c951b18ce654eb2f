Amanzimtoti residents have called on to grab a chance to make a child smile this Christmas. The initiative, called the ‘Christmas Blessing Tree’, will be the first of its kind this year as four businesses in the area will house a Christmas tree decorated with names of children in need. The community can pop into these businesses from 29 October and ‘adopt’ a child to purchase a gift for. Pastor John Matney of the Faith Baptist Church is the organiser of the event. He said that although 2020 has been a rough year worldwide, this initiative will hopefully ensure that some children can have a happy ending to the year. Matney said: “We have four businesses in Amanzimtoti that will have a tree up in their shop. Thirsty Whale on Amanzimtoti main beach, Braai en Lawaai, Giselle’s kitchen and So Pro Branding have so graciously allowed us the opportunity to house the trees and we hope that patrons come through to assist in this cause.” With this year being the launch of the drive, the organisers hope to make this maiden run a success proving the possibility of future initiatives. “We obviously will not be able to care for every child that comes to us this year but we hope to grow this initiative across Amanzimtoti and surrounding areas. We are hopeful that with the success of this year, we grow much bigger next year by making sure that as many children as possible get a Christmas gift, whose parents would normally not be able to afford it. This will make their Christmas extra special,” Matney said. The organisers are appealing to the community to support this effort by taking a card off the tree and sponsoring a gift for a child. They are also seeking donations to provide food parcels for a number of families this Christmas. Gifts need to be purchased, wrapped and returned to the tree by 20 November.
