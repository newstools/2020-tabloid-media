The eThekwini Municipality has sent out a warning to its customers following complaints from residents who were scammed by fraudsters pretending to be municipal employees sent to collect outstanding debts. Msawakhe Mayisela, municipal spokesperson, distanced the city from the alleged scammers. He said that municipal bills are only paid at their service centres and not to any individual who comes knocking at the door. He said: “Customers are urged to look out for fraudsters pretending to be municipal employees. They allegedly knock on people’s doors telling them that their municipal accounts are in arrears and they need to pay them for their debt to disappear. Customers are advised to not fall for that scam and report it to the police.” A resident in Ward 65, whose identity is known to the paper, said that she was almost a victim of this incident recently. She said: “They were here in Escombe and I tried to take a picture of the guy but he kept on turning his face away. He was wearing eThekwini overalls and I knew he was trying to scam me as I had collected my account from the municipal offices on the same day and it definitely was not behind.” Samantha Windvogel, ward 65 councillor, has also cautioned all residents against this new modus operandi and encourages them to report the matter as soon as it happens to bring criminals to book.
