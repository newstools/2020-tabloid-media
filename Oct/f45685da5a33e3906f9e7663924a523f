A Folweni High pupil is facing charges of murder after fatally stabbing another pupil in a gang violence related incident at the school, recently. Rampant gangsterism at the school, under the Umlazi District, has led to fear as the school management battles to get the volatile situation under control. KwaZulu-Natal Education MEC, Kwazi Mshengu, visited the school on Monday, 5 October, to intervene following the unfortunate incident. Mshengu said that they had to intervene as the situation had become unstable and pupils are no longer able to attend, due to fears of retaliation. He said: “There are different groups, pupils have categorised themselves into different gangs. The situation has become volatile and the pupils are now scared to come to school out of fear of being attacked.” The fatal stabbing incident occurred last week. It is alleged that a gang fight broke out on school premises which resulted in in the death of a Grade 9 pupil. Mshengu said: “We have to draw a redline and say that our school will not be a den for criminals. So we met with the pupils who have identified themselves as gang members and asked them to leave the school immediately.” He said that pupils were asked to only return to school in the company of their parents. Mshengu said that he wants a commitment from both pupils and parents that should they do anything that is against the code of conduct, they will be expelled. “We do not want a situation where the majority of pupils attend school under fear. Even teachers are no longer safe, so we really need to remove these rotten potatoes if they do not repent,” said Mshengu.
