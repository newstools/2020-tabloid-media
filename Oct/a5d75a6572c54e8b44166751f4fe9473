It’s promising to be a big weekend for Chatsworth Centre who are getting ready to host comediennes Jardel and Shanice on Saturday, 24 October. Chatsworth’s viral sensations will meet their fans, for laughter to last them a lifetime, at Shoprite foyer on Saturday, 24 October from 11am to 1pm. Residents can look forward to meeting their favourite local comedians and will be allowed to take pictures with the pair.
“As the heart of the community, we feel that it is our duty to recognise such potential and allow a platform for growth. We are extremely excited to be a part of the journey which sees these two Chatsworth born and raised youngsters break the internet while putting their hometown on the map,” the centre said. If you have Facebook, be sure to check out the event on the Chatsworth Centre page and share with your friends.
