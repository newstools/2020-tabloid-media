Ballito resident, Nikki Williamson will be hosting a two day environmental walk from Tinley Manor in Ballito to eMdloti on Saturday, 14 and Sunday, 15 November. Williamson has labelled her walk as the “Mini Philocaly Trail” meaning “The Love of Beauty” which aims to raise awareness of the province’s perfect coastline while also addressing the threat that oceans are currently facing with plastic pollution. Earlier in the month, Williamson hosted a five-day Philocaly Trail from Mtunzini to Sheffield Beach which raised R100 000 that will shared between environmental organisation, Wild Oceans and Breathe Conservation. “It was fantastic raising so much for two phenomenal organisations and even though we had 430 participants join in over the five days, we still had people who missed out and still wanted to be part of this journey. So I decided to host a ‘Mini Philocaly Trail’ over a weekend which gives more people an opportunity to join in,” she said. “It is a distance of 33 kilometres on the beach and I feel it will be such an eye-opening experience as this part of our coastline is stunning,” she added.
