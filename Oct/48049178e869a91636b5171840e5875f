In a surprising twist of events, a suspect who broke into a store to remove items, found himself locked inside overnight and was removed by police, on Friday morning. A shop owner at a prominent business centre in Berea, Durban, received the surprise of his life when he arrived at work on Friday morning to find a suspect who had got himself locked inside the store. “The shop owner made the surprise discovery when he entered the store and noticed that the shop had been ransacked,” said Andreas Mathios, Blue Security community and media liaison officer. He said that when he viewed CCTV footage he saw that a suspect was still inside his shop. Further investigation by the security company on guard duty revealed that the suspect had somehow got himself locked up inside the store and spent the night behind a cupboard.
“Blue Security was immediately despatched to the scene and the suspect was detained. The suspect, who was a foreign national, was found in possession of R4 000 in cash as well as various other items of value that he had collected in the store during the night,” he added. “Metro Police also responded to the scene to assist. The store remained closed for the duration of the morning. An investigation is being conducted by SAPS,” Mathios said.
