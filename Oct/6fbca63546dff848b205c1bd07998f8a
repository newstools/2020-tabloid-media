One of KwaZulu-Natal Cricket and the Hollywoodbets Dolphins most loved sons Cody Chetty has called time on his cricketing career as he and his fiancé pursue interests beyond the borders of South Africa. A KwaZulu-Natal man through and through, Chetty was educated at Glenwood High School before moving to the Dolphins Academy where he continued to flourish as a cricketer following a first-class debut at 17-years-old. He formed part of the SA Under 19 side that went to the World Cup in New Zealand, he has been part of the SA Academy and represented the SA A team through his professional career that has spanned over a decade. “I want to thank everyone at the KwaZulu-Natal Cricket Union for the past eleven years. It is with a heavy heart and a lump in my throat that I say goodbye to the Union and franchise that I grew up watching and loving as a kid. I can’t thank the players and staff at KZN Cricket enough for everything that you have done for me and the memories that we have created, I’ll cherish them forever,” Chetty said. He formed an important part in the Hollywoodbets Dolphins dressing room over the years and was part of a memorable side that won the RAM Slam T20 Tournament in 2013/14 and then most recently the squad that won the Momentum One Day Cup. In an age of professionalism, having a player that has committed their whole career to one union can be rare and Chetty’s decision to move on from cricket will leave a hole at the union. “We want to thank Cody for his years of service and dedication to cricket in KwaZulu-Natal,” CEO of KZN Cricket Heinrich Strydom said. “For a player to spend their entire career at one union is an incredible example of loyalty and that is something that everyone appreciates about Chetty. A fine cricketer and an even better person off the field we wish Chetty and his fiancé all the very best on their new adventure,” said Strydom.
