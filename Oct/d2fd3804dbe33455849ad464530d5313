A Phoenix resident’s future was snuffed out in the blink of an eye leaving him fatally stabbed when he joined his brother in the pursuit of fleeing suspects from his neighbour’s property in Westham, during the early hours of this morning (Wednesday, 21 October). The 25-year-old man attempted to apprehend robbery suspects on Quintham Place but instead was brutally stabbed and died on the side of the road. Members of Reaction Unit South Africa (Rusa) arrived on scene at approximately 1.33am and found the man lying on the roadside. Rusa head, Prem Balram, said: “The victim sustained a single stab wound to his chest. Medics assessed the victim and found that he showed no signs of life. It was established that the deceased had arrived home from work and was watching television when he heard gunshots.” Balram said that upon investigation, the deceased noticed two suspects fleeing from his neighbour’s property. The call centre employee and his brother pursued the suspects on foot. At one stage the deceased managed to apprehend one of the suspects who drew either a knife or a screwdriver and stabbed him. The suspect then fled leaving the fatally injured man on the ground. “Information retrieved alleged that the deceased was expected to tie the knot with his girlfriend early next year. Sadly, his good samaritan deed cost him his life. We urge community members to call the authorities or security service providers when suspects are spotted. Criminals are often armed and ruthless. They are not averse to taking a life or causing serious injury when they are caught out. We extend our condolences to the bereaved family during this difficult time,” Balram added.
