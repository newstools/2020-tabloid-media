The Westville SAPS is encouraging firearm owners whose licences have expired to make use of the amnesty period as it has been extended to 31 January 2021. Elizabeth Squires, Westville SAPS communication officer said that the amnesty period was announced by Minister of police, Bheki Cele in December last year where he sought to urge members of the public who are in possession of illegal firearms or whose firearm licences have expired to hand in their firearms. “The firearm amnesty served as an indemnity against prosecution for unlawful possession of firearm and ammunition. Failure to reapply for a firearm licence during the amnesty period may result in a criminal prosecution. Firearms that people unlawfully have in their possession, unwanted firearms, and unregistered firearms may be surrendered during the amnesty period,” Squires said. She requested those who need further information to phone the appointed amnesty officers at Westville SAPS, Warrant Officer, van Staden on 031 2677376 or Warrant Officer Govender on 031 2677373 from Monday to Friday between 8am and 3pm.
