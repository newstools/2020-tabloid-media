The 64-year-old boyfriend of a slain woman, 34, and her two-year-old daughter was arrested in Mount Royal for the heinous double murder, on Wednesday night. Captain L Naidoo, Phoenix SAPS communications officer said that it is alleged by members who attended the crime scene in Mount Royal that on Wednesday at 10:35pm they had received a complaint of a murder where police members found the 34-year-old with gashes all over her body. “She was declared dead at the scene. The two-year-old was also seriously hacked with the bush knife and was rushed to the local hospital in a critical condition. Unfortunately, the toddler succumbed to her injuries as she reached the hospital,” Naidoo said. According to Naidoo, witnesses stated they heard screams coming from the home of
the deceased. “The suspect had fled the scene before police arrival. Enquiries were conducted in the area and it was established that the suspect was the boyfriend of the deceased. “A member of Phoenix SAPS received a call the very same night that the partner of the deceased was at the house. Members responded to the call and successfully arrested the suspect,” said Naidoo. She said that the suspect Thembinkosi Ngcobo was later charged and appeared in the Verulam Magistrate’s Court on Friday.
