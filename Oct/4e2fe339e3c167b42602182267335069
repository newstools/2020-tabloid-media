The South Durban Community Environmental Alliance (SDCEA) will be hosting its annual cancer walk on Wednesday, 21 October. Joanne Groom, communications and media officer for the SDCEA said that the walk will start from Bedulla Road Graunds and will end at Highbury Grounds between 10 am and 12.30pm. The SDCEA which has created a growing community cancer surveillance campaign, also known as the cancer registry which began in 2017, aims at documenting all those living and deceased with cancer in the South Durban area. It also creates awareness around the links between poor air quality and the prevalence of harmful illnesses such as cancer and asthma. Groom said that as of February, the cancer registry consists of 159 patients, with 53 percent of their database consisting of females and lung cancer being the most common form of cancer on our database. “Countless years of being exposed to air pollution has caused great health impacts on the south Durban community, which suffers from respiratory illness, asthma, cancer and leukaemia. The SDCEA still continues to Campaign for a fully operational 24 hour clinic for those who are being affected by respiratory illnesses and cancer,” Groom said. “Many of our family members have been affected and have had to bear the medical cost of such illnesses. There are no benefits from the toxic air pollution. Our action is to raise awareness of the scourge of cancer and asthma prevalent in our communities directly or indirectly linked to the petro-chemical or chemical industries. All residents of south Durban and Durban are asked to please join the walk in honour of our loved ones who have died and continue to suffer from this dreadful disease,” she added.
