Nkosingiphile Morris Ngubane, 39, was sentenced to life imprisonment for the murder of  school teacher Hlengiwe Ndaba,35 in the Estcourt Regional Court on 23 October. Ngubane pleaded guilty at court. His sentence came after the court heard how pregnant school teacher, Hlengiwe Ndaba,35, was brutally killed. On 23 July, human remains were found in a burnt out vehicle. The body was burnt beyond recognition and the vehicle had bullet holes. The post-mortem revealed that the recovered remains were of a woman who was eight months pregnant. DNA tests were conducted and revealed that the body was of Ndaba, a teacher at a school in Amangwe. The investigating team from Winterton SAPS followed all possible leads to crack the case and seize all the suspects involved. The team worked tirelessly to bring the suspect’s to book. On 1 September, the team made a breakthrough when Nokubonga Fortunate Dubazane, 35, was arrested at Estcourt for the murder. The accused was a teacher at the same school as the deceased. Mqapheli Miya,46, was arrested on 3 September at Emmaus for the same case. On 26 September, the third accused Nkosingiphile Morris Ngubane,39, was traced and arrested at Tembisa in Gauteng where he was hiding. The case against the other two accused was adjourned to 29 October at the Colenso Magistrate’s Court. KwaZulu-Natal Provincial Commissioner, Lieutenant General Khombinkosi Jula praised the Winterton SAPS investigating officer for thoroughly investigating the murder case which led to the successful prosecution of the accused. “I am pleased with the sentence handed down against the accused and we hope that this sentence will bring comfort to the family,” he said.
