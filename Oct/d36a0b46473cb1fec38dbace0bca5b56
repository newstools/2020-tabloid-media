  Anappeal has been made by police for anyone with information on the disappearance of five-year-old Qobhile Cele, to come forward. Cele, went missing on 29 August 2019 and is yet to be found. Colonel Thembeka Mbele, KwaZulu-Natal police spokesperson, said that an appeal was initially made last year, following the five-year-old’s disappearance. “Despite this appeal being circulated in September last year, no person has come forward,” Mbele said. Cele, who resides at Noqhongo in Mehlomnyama, was last seen by her grandmother on 29 August 2019, playing outside her home. When she went missing, Cele was dressed in a red jacket, blue plastic shoes and grey track pants.
