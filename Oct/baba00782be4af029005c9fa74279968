Two accused, who are facing charges of murdering Hlengiwe Ndaba, who was 8 months pregnant at the time of her murder, appeared in the Colenso Magistrate’s Court today (Thursday, 15 October). The 37-year-old female teacher, who taught at the same school as Ndaba and a 46-year-old man, were arrested for the gruesome murder earlier this month. The African National Congress Women’s League (ANCWL) and members of the National Education Health and Allied Workers Union (NEHAWU) demonstrated peacefully outside the Colenso Magistrate court in support of the Phasiwe Primary School Grade 4 teacher, whose burnt remains were found in a burnt bakkie in the Winterton area on 23 July. The demonstrators called for justice to be served, as the two accused appeared briefly in court. The accused bail application was denied. It is said that a third suspect will also appear in the Colenso Magistrate court in connection with the murder. All three accused will remain in police custody and will appear in court on 29 October.
