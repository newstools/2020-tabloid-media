Gauteng remains the epicentre with 221 061 cases since the outbreak, followed by KwaZulu-Natal with 119 694, the Western Cape 111 517 and the Eastern Cape 89 964. “Our recoveries now stand at 615 684, which translates to a recovery rate of 90 percent” said Health Minister, Dr Zweli Mkhize. The information is based on 4 280 340 tests conducted, 10 714 of which were performed in the last 24 hours. According to the World Health Organisation (WHO), globally, the number of new cases per week has remained stable at two million for the past three weeks. Meanwhile, over one million deaths have now been reported globally, of which majority were reported in the region of the Americas (55 percent), followed by Europe (23 percent). “In the past week, the regions of the Americas, South-East Asia and Europe account for 91 percent of new cases,” the latest WHO report stated. The highest percentage of cases has been reported in the 25 – 39 age groups, with about 50 percent of cases in the 25 – 64 age groups. “However, the percentage of deaths increases with age, and approximately 75 percent of deaths are those aged 65 years and above,” said the report. South Africa and Ethiopia continue to report the highest numbers of new cases in Africa, followed by Mozambique, Uganda and Nigeria. “Africa has seen a continuous decline in case incidence since mid-July, however, this trend is now slowing,” said WHO. For the first week since early August, the number of new deaths has risen, led by South Africa with a 29 percent increase in deaths in the past week. South Africa also has the second-highest mortality rate on the continent with 11 461 deaths per one million population. “Gauteng and the Western Cape have reported the most cases and deaths to date. However, these regions, as well as the country itself, have maintained sustained declines in the daily incidence since the end of July. Despite this, weekly case numbers have continued to rise in less populated provinces,” said WHO. A WHO surge team of experts, including infectious disease specialists and epidemiologists, continue to work with the Department of Health. Globally, there have been 35 777 158 confirmed cases of Covid-19, including 1 049 693 deaths reported and 26 907 314 recoveries.
