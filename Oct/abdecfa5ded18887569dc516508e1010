Waterloo residents were left reeling in shock after a 47-year-old man was found hanging from a tree in a bush opposite Phase 6, recently. Ward 58 councillor Geoff Pullan, said that the deceased was kicked out of the house following an argument with his girlfriend, shortly before he committed suicide. Pullan said: “I heard that after being kicked out of the house, the man decided to commit suicide. It seems like he suffered from depression and he had mental health issues since Covid-19 lockdown.” Captain Henry Kisten, Verulam police spokesperson, confirmed the incident. He said that there were no visible signs of a struggle or defensive wounds upon discovering a body in the bush. “An investigation is underway by Verulam SAPS. The body was taken to a government mortuary for a post-mortem to be held,” he said. Prem Balram of Reaction Unit South Africa (Rusa), said that the deceased was discovered by a passerby. “When our members arrived on scene they found Verulam SAPS and residents in attendance. Paramedics assessed the man and declared him dead on the scene,” said Balram. He said that the deceased’s employee identification card was found in his possession. “Residents claimed that the man was seen walking around in the area before his disappearance,” said Balram. Nomalanga Mbhele, a resident, said that the incident left everyone shocked. “It was my first time seeing a person hanging from a tree. I am still shocked and traumatised by the incident,” she said. Mbhele said that there were no signs that the deceased attempted to remove the rope from his neck. Another resident Sifiso Ngwenya said that the deceased was a good man and he never had a quarrel with anyone in the area. “He was one of the coolest human beings I knew. But, lately I suspected there was something wrong with him as he was not greeting as usual,” said Ngwenya.
