Since lockdown pushed the country deeper into recession and thousands of jobs were lost as the economy went into free fall, crime levels have spiked and the Tafta elders feel threatened after several attempted break-ins were reported at two of their homes. Femada Shamam, Tafta CEO said that as Tafta they sympathise with desperate, starving people, however, the threat to vulnerable elders is now very real, following attempted break-ins at the John Dunn House in Wentworth and Tafta Park in Bellair. “Both homes have been targeted, leaving many of our elders feeling helpless during an already vulnerable time for older people. Thankfully, nobody has been hurt, yet. We can’t afford to take any chances as the elders are depending on us to keep them safe. This means continually looking at additional security measures which include electric fencing and beams, to keep criminal elements out,” said Shamam. She said that everyone is well aware that security does not come cheap. “An alarm system with panic buttons costs over R4000 with another R700 for a back up battery. Beams range from R1330 to nearly R8000 depending on the distance they cover and then there’s cabling at R325 per 100 metres and 6-strand electric fencing at R183 per metre. “We urge the community to assist us with donations towards making our homes safe. Any amount you can contribute towards these costs would be appreciated so much by elders who worry about losing precious possessions or even being harmed by criminals breaking in to their home,” Shamam said. Shamam emphasised that the association has a formal fundraising team and all calls for donations and in kind are initiated by this department through professional channels of communication with supporters. “We have never, and will not call on elders to lead fundraising appeals.” Any queries in this regard should
