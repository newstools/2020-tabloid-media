After evading police for almost three days, a 31-year-old murder suspect has been found deceased. The man accused of killing his ex-girlfriend’s current partner, was on the run following the 3 October shooting incident. Captain Adam Francis, Scottburgh SAPS communication officer, said that the victim was shot and killed at around 3pm in Sezela. It is alleged that a 35-year-old female was visiting her boyfriend when they came under attack of her ex-boyfriend. Francis said that is when an argument ensued between the trio. “The ex-boyfriend then pulled a pistol and a shot went off from the firearm but it missed her. The current boyfriend intervened and she managed to run to the neighbours for help,” he said. The victim was able to get help and upon her return she found her boyfriend with gunshot wounds and realised that he had succumbed to his injuries on the scene. Francis said that the manhunt got underway and the investigation was assigned to Detective Sergeant Mohammed Bhaijee of Scottburgh Detective Service. “The suspect began to evade the police and on Tuesday, 6 October, at 11am Scottburgh SAPS was alerted to a dead male near Zamazoko Bottle Store in Sezela. “The wanted 31-year-old male was found dead with a single shot to his chest and a pistol was also found on the scene,” Francis said.
