Reaction Unit South Africa paramedics and reaction officers faced a gruesome scene on Saturday night when they watched a fellow colleague take his last breath after he was mowed down by an alleged speeding taxi in Verulam on Saturday night. Prem Balram, Rusa head said that an off duty member of Reaction Unit South Africa (RUSA) was tragically killed by a speeding taxi over the weekend. He said that the Rusa operations centre received calls from several passing motorists at about 7.19pm after they noticed a speeding taxi knock down a male attired in a black uniform. “Paramedics and reaction officers arrived on scene at the corner of Todd and Garden Street and found that the critically injured male was a colleague. The 33-year-old victim succumbed to his injuries a minute later,” Balram said. He said that witnesses informed Rusa members that the taxi was speeding excessively and ploughed into the deceased who was standing on the side of the road. “The taxi allegedly came to a halt about 100 metres from the point of impact with the victim stuck on the front left of the vehicle. According to the 28-year-old driver of a green and white Toyota Hiace taxi, he was traveling towards the Verulam CBD and had not seen the victim,” Balram added.
Police are investigating further.
