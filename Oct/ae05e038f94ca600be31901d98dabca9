The Umngeni Community Empowerment Centre (UCEC) is inviting the public to the seventh Annual Stop Human Trafficking virtual walk in aid of Shiloh House Crisis Centre from 9 to 11 October. Shiloh Crisis Centre is affiliated to UCEC and was founded in 2006 as a result of the empowerment centre’s ‘Women of Worth’ street ministries. This after finding an alarming number of abused women and children in need of refuge. Seeantha Naidoo of UCEC said that Shiloh House provides support and counselling services while serving as a safe haven for beneficiaries to deal with their circumstances while living a dignified life. “The centre is a place for temporary relief where victims of gender-based violence, human trafficking and other forms of abuse stay until they can be resettled sustainably. “Beneficiaries are provided with accommodation, food, clothing and toiletries, counselling, a care plan and referrals to specialised or long term services. Over and above these services, they are also assisted with health needs, a care plan personal development, typing of CV’s and applications for jobs, ID documents and grants,” said Naidoo. She said that for the walk participants have a choice of walking 5km, 10km, 15km and 21km, anywhere that they feel comfortable. Participants can register and pay on Quicket and entry fee starts at R45 for the 5km up to R150 for the 21km. Once registered, participants are urged to record their times and distances, upload pictures of themselves doing the walk on Instagram@UCECDURBAN using the hashtags #AHT2020 #Takeasteptakeastand.
