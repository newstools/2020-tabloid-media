A domestic dispute between a husband and wife on Ridge Road in Essenwood led to the man firing a shot at his spouse and his subsequent arrest on a charge of attempted murder, on Friday. Police officers from the Ethekwini District and Mayville detectives arrested the suspect ,49, for attempted murder, illegal possession of firearms as well as ammunition. He appeared in the Durban Magistrate’s Court on 25 September. Colonel Thembeka Mbele, provincial police spokesperson said: “It is alleged that on 21 September, a couple had an argument while at their home on Ridge Road and the husband drew a firearm and fired a shot towards the wife but he missed. The wife fled from the house. A case of attempted murder was opened at the Mayville police station for investigation.” On Friday morning, police proceeded to the premises, searching for the suspect. “A search was conducted and the suspect was found in possession of a shotgun, a revolver and a pistol in his possession with a number of rounds of ammunition. He was immediately arrested,” Mbele added. The acting provincial commissioner, Major General Thulani Gonya applauded police for the arrest. “We are urging members of the community to hand in illegal firearms during this current amnesty period,” he said.
