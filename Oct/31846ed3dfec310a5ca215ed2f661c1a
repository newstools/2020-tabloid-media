The death toll of the head-on collision between a truck and taxi along the R34 – Melmoth/Ulundi route on 21 October has risen to 16. Among the dead, is an unborn baby. The taxi burst into flames on impact. Three of the 16 passengers were burnt beyond recognition. MEC for Transport, Community Safety and Liaison Bheki Ntuli said: ” This accident is one of the most gruesome accidents I have ever experienced because 16 people perished, including a pregnant woman who delivered a stillborn infant on the scene. It pains me that families had to lose their loved ones especially during October Transport Month, as we are busy conducting service delivery activities which includes launching high-impact infrastructure projects in various parts of the province, that are key in unlocking economic opportunities.” Ntuli said that he will be involved in the investigation and working closely with municipalities to assist in identifying the deceased. Ntuli added that all factors will be taken into consideration when investigating the cause of the crash. “The cause of the accident will focus on the roadworthiness of both vehicles, the weather condition at the time of the accident and other causal factors that could have led to the accident, ” said Ntuli. Ntuli said that it is crucial for road users to be cognizant of the factors that contribute to road carnages such as speeding and driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs. ” We are committed to ending road carnage and will continue to ensure road safety in the province through strategic traffic enforcement, education and robust community engagement,” he said.
