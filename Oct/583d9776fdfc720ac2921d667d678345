The Durban & Coast SPCA said 79 dogs and cats have been re-homed during the level 3 national lockdown. While the substantial number of adoptions was celebrated by the SPCA, there are still hundreds of animals waiting to find loving homes. Tanya Fleischer marketing manager for the SPCA, said that they collected 280 strays and received 550 stray and unwanted animals from the public during level 4 and 5 of the nationwide lockdown. Fleishcer is appealing to the community to remember the SPCA when adopting pets. “These 79 animals that were recently adopted were previously unwanted, stray, abandoned or abused. They are now with loving families. We currently have 32 animals up for adoption, there are always animals looking for their forever homes. Please adopt, don’t shop, if you are looking to add a companion to your home,” Fleishcer said. She said that the process includes four steps, starting with a visit to the SPCA to choose a pet. “Pet owners are encouraged to consider the size of their property, the other pets they own and the age of their children when choosing their pets. Thereafter, the SPCA will conduct a home inspection to ensure the property is well suited for the pet.
The animal is then sterilised before the adoption process is complete,” she added. If someone would like to adopt, they need to make an appointment by calling
