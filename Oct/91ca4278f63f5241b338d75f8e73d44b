An e-hailing driver was left uninjured but traumatised after hijackers posing as passengers held him up and forced him into the boot of his Renault Triber in Newlands, before crashing into a vehicle while making a getaway in Phoenix, on Thursday evening. Members of Reaction Unit South Africa (Rusa) were called out to the scene of a collision in Phoenix at approximately 8.24pm after three men were seen fleeing from the Renault Triber after it collided into a VW Jetta. “A man who claimed to be a driver for the e-hailing company was freed from the boot of the vehicle by the public. On arrival, it was established that the Uber driver’s service was requested in Newlands West. When the driver arrived at the pick-up point he was accosted by three men. Two of the men produced firearms and forced him into the boot of his vehicle. The third suspect was armed with a knife. The hijackers then sped off and drove at high speed towards Phoenix,” said Rusa head, Prem Balram. He added: “As they approached a service station a VW Jetta in front of them slowed down to turn into the filling station when the Renault Triber attempted to overtake. Both vehicles collided and the tyre on the Renault Triber burst . The hijackers then abandoned the vehicle and fled the scene on foot. The victim was not injured but was visibly shaken.” Balram said that reaction officers searched for the suspects but no arrests were made.
