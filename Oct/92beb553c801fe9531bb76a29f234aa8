  Sydenham SAPS is seeking assistance in the investigation of a murder case where the skeletal remains of a human being were found in the dense bush on Rippon Road, on 29 September. Communications officer at Sydenham SAPS, Captain Myen Lazarus, said: “The deceased had a rosary chain with a cross and a distinctive ‘Lawrence’ watch entangled on the remains. An inquest case was initially registered. On 8 October, a post mortem was conducted on the remains and the pathologist concluded that the remains most likely belong to an African male between 20 to 40-years-old.”
“The charge was changed to murder when an entry and exit hole was found on the skull most likely being a bullet hole. The charge then changed to murder. The deceased was found attired in a black Nike tracksuit, white Nike takkies size 7 or 8, a red and white rosary with a cross and a red Lawrence wristwatch with red stones on the band,” said Cpt Lazarus. “The pathologist estimates the person was killed between a month and six months,” Cpt Lazarus added. The case is being investigated by Warrant Officer Cliffy Reddi. Anyone with any information that can assist Sydenham SAPS in this murder investigation can contact W/O Reddi on 084-556-6032 or 031- 202-2808.
