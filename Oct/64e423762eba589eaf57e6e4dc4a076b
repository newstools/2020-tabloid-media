Umgeni River bird Park has been rejuvenated with a new graffiti make over by a Durban North resident, Gift Duminy. Duminy has been responsible for all the graffiti artworks in and around the Durban North area and has worked with a Durban North organisation Enviro Fixers. The organisation which is known for safeguarding the environment by replacing alien invader plants with indigenous plants commissioned Duminy to paint the three bird species artwork that one may be lucky enough to see if they walk the Fish Eagle Trail along the Umgeni River. The three graffiti artwork are the Goliath Hero, African Fish Eagle and the Mangrove Kingfisher. Duminy said that the sub-station which was covered in an advert is now painted grey with the three indigenous birds. “I love the colours on the panels and I think the African Fish Eagle which is in the front shows off really nicely. “The other one is the Goliath Hero which is the largest species in the world and on the other two sides there are Mangrove Kingfishers, they are really magnificent birds. I feel really honoured to be asked to paint these public murals and inspire a little appreciation for nature and I hope through that appreciation some conservation will happen,” Duminy said. “All thanks must go to the Enviro Fixers who are making big strides to beautify Durban North. The reactions from the community have been extremely positive which makes it all worth it,” he added.
