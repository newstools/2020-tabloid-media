It was a case of being in the wrong place at the wrong time when an unsuspecting customer was shot and killed while walking towards a tuck-shop which was being robbed by armed suspects, in Malengeni, recently. Captain Adam Francis, Scottburgh SAPS communications officer, said that the incident occurred on 17 October at 3.15pm. He said that the owner of the tuck-shop in Malengeni was offloading his stock from his vehicle when he was confronted by two suspects wielding firearms. “He was forced by gunpoint to go into the shop and to lay on the floor. The cashier was then threatened to hand over the cash from the till. While the robbery was taking place, a customer drove into the premises and as he was walking towards the tuck-shop. He was shot by a suspect who was keeping observation on the outside,” Francis said. The suspects fled with cash in a white getaway vehicle. Francis said: “An appeal is made to the public to contact the nearest SAPS on 10111 or CrimeStop on 08600 10111with regards to suspicious persons and suspicious vehicles.
