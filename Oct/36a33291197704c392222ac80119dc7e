A house robbery case is under investigation after two masked men wielding firearms removed a safe containing R73 000 stokvel cash from a house in Bhambayi and fled, recently. Captain L Naidoo, Phoenix SAPS communications officer said that the complainant alleged that on the day she brought home R73 000 of stokvel cash which she locked in an unmounted safe, a man came looking for accommodation and she informed him there was none.
“The next day at 7am, the main gate was opened because the children were ready to go to school. A child, 9, went to buy bread. On the way back she was followed by two unknown men wearing masks. Both men had firearms and knives in their possession and demanded the safe keys,” Naidoo said. She added: “The complainant refused to give them the keys to the safe. One male went straight to the room and took the safe which was not mounted to the wall. He put the safe in a black bin bag.
The suspects took the safe containing R73, 000 cash, a Nokia 3310 cellphone and three Ithala Bank cards. They then fled the scene.”
