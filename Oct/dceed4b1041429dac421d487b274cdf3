The search for a drowning victim in the Rookdale Canal has finally been called off, after Okhahlamba Search and Rescue recovered the body of a 40-year-old man, on Monday afternoon (5 October). The Rookdale Canal is situated about 20km from Bergville. The incident was reported by a Bergville resident, who told police that residents were walking along the Rookdale Canal, when they heard someone scream for help, on Friday. On further inspection, they saw a man in the deep canal being swept away. Ladysmith K9 Search and Rescue spent most of Friday searching the waters of the canal. Pietermaritzburg K9 Search and Rescue and divers were also called in to assist in the search which continued for most of the morning, but with no success. Bergville police and Okhahlamba Search and Rescue reported to the area to monitor the canal. With a third search of the canal Okhahlamba Search and Rescue found the body. The body has not been officially identified as yet. An inquest is being investigated by the Bergville police.
