A Phoenix shop owner has levelled allegations of theft against five Phoenix SAPS police officers who he claims stole his money when they searched his store for cigarettes, recently. Speaking to the Phoenix Tabloid, the complainant who prefers to remain anonymous to protect his safety, alleges that five policemen entered his shop and searched for cigarettes. “They found three cartons of cigarettes that were old stock and were not being sold in the shop. They threateningly demanded R6 000 and when I failed to give any money, they took R15 000 from the cash counter. The police officers forced me to hand over my car keys which were in my friend’s possession. In the car they found cash to the value of R10 525 that was set aside for a supplier and took that as well,” said the aggrieved complainant. The complainant further alleged that the policemen transported him in the police van to the Phoenix police station where a case was opened against him. He appeared in court on 3 July and was granted bail. He is due to appear in court again on 17 September.
“I have opened a case against the police at the Phoenix police station for theft of money. The money that they took was my hard earned cash which I need to pay my supplier. They committed a sin by stealing my cash. God is watching,” the distressed complainant added. Phoenix SAPS communications officer Captain Louise Naidoo confirmed that a case of theft has been opened at the station and that investigations are ongoing.
