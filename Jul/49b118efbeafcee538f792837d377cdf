The family of slain Keagan Chetty who was gunned down in full view of his wife in a drive-by shooting in Isipingo is offering a reward of R100 000 for any information on the gunmen who murdered the Orient Hills dad. Chetty, 36, was killed on 11 June, at around 7am, in the car park of his flat in Tangerine Grove, Orient Hills. There have been no arrests since his killing. KwaZulu-Natal police spokesperson, Colonel Thembeka Mbele said that no arrests have been made as yet. She said: “On 11 June, a couple and a neighbour were chatting outside their place of residence on Tangerine Drive in Isipingo when an unknown vehicle with three occupants emerged. They fired multiple shots at the husband, 36, fatally wounding him and drove off. Whilst driving off, they fired randomly at the building and one of the residents was shot and injured. A case of murder and attempted murder was opened at Isipingo police station for investigation.” The family of the deceased is seeking a breakthrough in the case with the arrest of the suspects. Isipingo Community Policing Forum (CPF) chairman, Aidan David said that they are sick and tired of crime in the area “Criminals who think that they are untouchable and who believe that they can get away from the might of the law should really think again as the community has a strong partnership with the South African Police Service. We will do everything in our power to make sure that information pertaining to this crime will be filtered to the investigating officers to assist in solving this crime.”
Chetty is survived by his six-year-old daughter, Kaylee Chetty, and wife, Dalene Chetty. Anyone with information has been asked to contact the local police station CrimeStop on 0860 10111. Alternatively contact 073 216 9195.
