The Minister of Health, Dr Zweli Mkhize, has warned the people of KwaZulu-Natal that they could soon be living in the epicentre of the South African Covid-19 pandemic, as the number of infections rise at an alarming rate in the province. “We appeal to South Africans to take Covid-19 seriously, wear a mask and sanitise your hands. We are still hearing of people moving around without masks and hosting parties. This is very serious. “We expect the numbers in KwaZulu-Natal to increase and for the province to be the second highest in numbers after Gauteng,” Mkhize said. As the province works on reducing the number of those infected with the novel coronavirus, KZN Premier Sihle Zikalala recently confirmed that health care workers (HCWs) account for 1 557 of the 45 614 cases reported in the province as of 21 July. Zikalala said: “Approximately 60 percent of the infected HCWs are nurses. Of the total infected, less than a percentage have succumbed to the disease since the beginning of the pandemic. Nevertheless, those deaths are 12 too many. This is not the time to lower our guard, but to up the ante and prevent further infections.” South Africa currently is the fifth highest country, in the world, with the number of people infected, with Covid-19. More than 375 000 Covid-19 cases have been recorded in SA,
with close to 200 000 recoveries and 5 173 deaths reported on 20 July. KZN ranks among the top five provinces in the country with the largest number of infections, with over 45 600 cases, of which 31 234 are still active. The eThekwini District remains the epicentre of the province, leading with over 22 000 infections. Zikalala said that the spike in cases is growing at an alarming rate. “As predicted, our curve is rising as we continue to see a sustained rate of transmissions in the province, just as in the rest of the country. A week ago, we had 23 751 positive cases, of which 17 450 were still active, 280 deaths, and 6021 recoveries. “This therefore means that in just one week, we have had 19 706 new Covid-19 cases, 136 new deaths, and 5 034 additional recoveries,” Zikalala said. Last week, the province contributed 21 percent of the new cases reported nationally and continues to be the fourth highest countrywide. The number of cases reported in the province since the beginning of July is 1 667, as of 19 July. As of 18 July, the province had 1 612 patients admitted in both private and public hospitals. Of those admitted, 265 patients required intensive care and 139 are being ventilated.
