  Lebogang Mahlangu, KwaZulu-Natal’s Miss SA top 15 semi-finalist, recently joined volunteers at the Red Cross Society to provide hot meals and medical attention to Tongaat residents during Mandela Day. The drive which was initiated by the Miss South Africa Organisation in conjunction with the pageant’s sponsor Brand SA, gave an opportunity to semi-finalists to make a difference in their provinces and neighbourhoods. Speaking to the Tongaat and Verulam Tabloid, Mahlangu said: “I spent the day with the Red Cross Society volunteers preparing meal parcels, which were distributed to over 200 residents.” She explained that the experience was humbling as all the food was prepared in one of the volunteers’ home. “Seeing people, who themselves have very little, sacrificing their time and resources to help others, is truly inspiring,” said Mahlangu. Mahlangu described the initiative as a true picture of Ubuntu and inline with the spirit of Mandela Day. “This is something we should all aspire to,” she added. Another finalist, Matsepo Sithole who was in Pietermaritzburg for Mandela Day, said: “We did a clean up campaign as well as visiting wards within the Edendale area distributing food parcels. I have to say that it was an amazing day and I really enjoyed making a difference and playing my part,” she said.
Stephanie Weil, CEO of Miss South Africa Organisation, said: “We are proud of all the girls, who willingly and with much enthusiasm, gave of their time to make a difference on Mandela Day.”<img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-48701" src="https://tabloidmedia.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Miss-SA-finalist-uplifts-Tongaat-1-768x1024.jpg" alt="" width="696" height="928" srcset="https://tabloidmedia.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Miss-SA-finalist-uplifts-Tongaat-1-768x1025.jpg 768w, https://tabloidmedia.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Miss-SA-finalist-uplifts-Tongaat-1-225x300.jpg 225w, https://tabloidmedia.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Miss-SA-finalist-uplifts-Tongaat-1-696x929.jpg 696w, https://tabloidmedia.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Miss-SA-finalist-uplifts-Tongaat-1-315x420.jpg 315w, https://tabloidmedia.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Miss-SA-finalist-uplifts-Tongaat-1.jpg 787w" sizes="(max-width: 696px) 100vw, 696px" />
