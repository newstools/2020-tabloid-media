An inquest has been opened at the Phoenix police station after a ‘baby’ was found abandoned and partially buried along the banks between Fairlawn Crescent and Stonebridge Drive on Friday morning, 10 July. Communications officer at Phoenix SAPS Captain Louise Naidoo, said: “According to information received, members of Slovo Tactical Support Unit made the discovery when they were chasing a suspect down the bank. The baby’s head and body was partially buried. The Slovo team cordoned off the area and police took over the scene. It was alleged the baby was about one month old.” Naidoo said that an inspection of the body revealed that the deceased baby appeared to be premature with underdeveloped body features. “The umbilical cord was still intact. The post mortem will determine if the foetus was aborted naturally or intentionally. Results from the post mortem will also determine if the baby is human as the Murder Unit questioned the authenticity of the body,” added Naidoo.
