As the novel corornavirus (covid-19) steers its way through the town of Newcastle, the local municipality is just one of the latest victim in a string of places to have positive cases. In a statement released last week, the municipality confirmed one case from the electricity department and another from its IT unit. The statement said: “Newcastle Municipality can confirm that to date, 7 July, one staff member from the municipal electricity department has tested positive for Covid-19. The worker is an artisan responsible for distribution, maintenance and repairs. “The employee is currently in isolation, and in line with the Covid-19 Department of Health protocols. The electricity unit has been closed until necessary disinfection and decontamination measures are conducted,” said the statement.
The municipality said that six more employees who have been in contact with the said staff member will undergo testing. The IT unit was also temporarily closed after a service provider confirmed to have tested positive for the coronavirus. “Staff from the department have been asked to self-isolate whilst the office undergoes disinfection. The main municipal building will remain open and serve the public whilst also adhering to safety measures. Residents are urged not to panic or be alarmed as the municipality is working closely with the Department of Health,” said the statement.
