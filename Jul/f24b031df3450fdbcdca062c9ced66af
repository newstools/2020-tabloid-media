To detect coronavirus (Covid-19) positive cases early and to track and trace their contacts for testing, isolation or quarantine, the government launched a track and trace system called COVIDConnect on Friday, 17 July. COVIDConnect is an “easy-to-use self-service portal to your cellular phone” and is freely accessible through WhatsApp and SMS on any mobile phone. It does not require a smart phone. Dr Zweli Mkhize said that in the past few weeks some members of the public may have received SMS’s from the health department about their test results or that they have been identified as a contact of a Covid-19 positive patient. He said that since the system went live in June it has yielded “positive results.” Between 28 June and 15 July, it has dispatched 674 380 SMSes to users nationwide and relayed 326 522 test results. 39,463 users have engaged with the service. “But this is not enough. The surge of this pandemic requires all citizens to participate to significantly enhance contact tracing” said Dr Mkhize. The system works as follows:
• When a patient tests for Covid-19, the information is picked up from the lab form and informs the patients of the test result, whether positive or negative, by SMS.
• If the result is positive, the system prompts the patient for information to identify their contacts. The system then dispatches alerts via SMS to the contacts without disclosing the patient’s details.
• The system can geo-locate the nearest quarantine, isolation facility and health care facility.
• Users can get the latest Covid-19 information and advice
• The simple risk assessment tool will screen for Covid-19 symptoms. “We want to inform the public that this track and trace service will not infringe people’s privacy or data. We delayed to implement the system to ensure that it adheres to legal prescripts relating to personal information, confidentiality and individual and data privacy. We look forward to many of our people taking part in this track and trace system,” said Dr Mkhize.
