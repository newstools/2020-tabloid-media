In the spirit of Mandela Day, Davenport Square recently handed over Personal Protective Equipment (PPE’s) to Carrington Heights Primary school in celebration of Mandela Month. This was part of the SA Corporate Real Estate Limited’s Support Our Schools(SOS) campaign. Mark Mac Kaiser, retail asset manager representing SA Corporate Real Estate Limited which owns the centre, noted that with the escalation of the Covid-19 pandemic and the need to keep both teachers and pupils who had returned to the classroom safe and healthy, Mandela Day 2020 was more important than ever. The shopping center donated masks and 100ml bottles of hand sanitisers to each of the 500 pupils of Carrington Heights. Dirks Butchery, who for years have formed a part of the community, couldn’t miss the opportunity to also show their support, by sponsoring two face shields for each of the 25 teachers and installed posters throughout the school to remind the children to practice social distancing and good personal hygiene. Davenport Square Junior Marketing Manager, Sesethu Senene said that they adopted Carrington Heights Primary School to be the beneficiaries of the SOS program. “Our aim was to focus on providing additional PPE items in the midst of the Covid-19 pandemic. We hope that this will go a long way to assist the school in creating a safe environment for the pupils and staff at Carrington Heights Primary,” said Senene.
