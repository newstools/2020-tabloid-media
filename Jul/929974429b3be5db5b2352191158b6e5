Netcare St Augustine’s Hospital in Durban has refuted claims of fresh Covid-19 cases at the hospital after a message on social media went viral on Tuesday, stating that the hospital will be closing down and that patients will be transferred to other hospitals. According to social media claims, six doctors and six nurses have contracted Covid-19 from patients. St Augustine’s Hospital general manager, Heinrich Venter said that there is no truth to a WhatsApp message about another Covid-19 outbreak at St. Augustine’s Hospital in Durban. “There is no truth whatsoever that Netcare St Augustine’s Hospital will be closing down today and that patients will be transferred to other hospitals, or that any doctors at the hospital have tested positive for Covid-19. “The message which seems to currently be circulating on WhatApp is fake and highly irresponsible,” Venter said in a statement. He said that it was a criminal offence to spread such fake news which will cause totally unnecessary concern and anxiety amongst the public and the loved ones of patients currently being cared for at the hospital.
In April, St Augustine’s Hospital had to shut down for sanitisation after 66 people, including 47 staff members, tested positive for the virus. Four people died. Another hospital that was mentioned in the message also confirmed that the news was fake. “This is fake news and has been reported to the relevant authorities. Ahmed Al-Kadi Private Hospital is prepared to treat any suspected cases of Covid-19 according to the National Institute of Communicable Diseases protocol,” said the hospital’s Ebrahim Asmal.
He said that any confirmed cases were being treated using relevant procedures implemented under the NICD, Department of Health and World Health Organ-isation’s guidance of the infection prevention and control strategies. “The hospital and its emergency units remain opened,” Asmal said.
