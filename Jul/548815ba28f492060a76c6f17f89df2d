As a precautionary measure, all services have been suspended with immediate effect and infected staff members have since gone into self-isolation and will follow all the necessary Covid-19 protocols, “read the statement. The KZN Department of Transport said that health workers have been alerted and necessary precautionary measures have been put in place for the rest of the staff members for assessment and screening to ensure a safe environment for all.
