To celebrate Nelson Mandela’s birthday, held annually on 18 July, people locally and abroad used the opportunity to take action, spread hope and inspire change just as Mandela did every day. Comedian Natashia Portrag, better known as “Bash with Tash” teamed up with the Phoenix Crisis Centre and the Phoenix SAPS as well as other entertainers to give hope to vulnerable communities, whilst making every day a Mandela Day. Keeping in mind the global Coronavirus pandemic that is wreaking havoc around the world, and affecting everyone, the team partnered up to deliver a month full of Mandela Day Initiatives to the vulnerable in old age homes and communities such as Mount Moriah, Mount Royale, Rink green, Verulam , Chatsworth, Phoenix and surrounding areas. The selfless team, with their volunteers worked around the clock to achieve their amazing goals. Speaking to The Phoenix Tabloid Natashia said that the core focus were the vulnerable in the community, which included the children and the elderly. “On Mandela Day, the team began with an interfaith prayer by the Moulana, Pastors and Pundits. SAPS and Metro escorted the team into the areas. The distribution took about nine hours.  Strict social distance protocols, hand-washing and sanitising as well as wearing of masks in line with lockdown regulations were adhered to, “she said. She said that the drives focused on distributing 2500 bunnies for week one, 2000 packs of breyani for week two, 1000 party packs on Mandela Day, 1000 vienna rolls, 750 masks, 400 shields, 300 flasks, 1000 hygiene packs, 500 muffins, 50 loafs of bread, 900 tea sachets, 120 sandwiches , 500 bottled water and 500 cold drinks. “We now only have the ‘Wash it off” drive with over 6000 soaps and the “Home make over” left to do. We thank all our sponsors that have partnered with us,” added Natashia.
