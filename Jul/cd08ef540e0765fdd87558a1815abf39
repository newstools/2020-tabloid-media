An 18-year-old teenager is fortunate to have escaped the clutches of three suspects after they assaulted and kidnapped him causing him to fight his way out of the vehicle and flee, in the Durban CBD, on Wednesday, 24 June. KwaZulu Natal police spokesperson, Colonel Thembeka Mbele said that it is alleged on 24 June at 11am, an 18-year-old teenager was assaulted and kidnapped by known suspects while working at his father’s business premises situated in the Point area. “The suspects forced the man into a vehicle and sped off whilst trying to extort money from his father. At the corner of Smith and Gardiner Street, the kidnapped victim managed to get out of the vehicle and flee the scene. He immediately reported the matter at Point SAPS for investigation,” Mbele said. She said that the Ethekwini District Task Team immediately followed up information about the suspects involved. The investigation led them to the Verulam area and at 5pm, a sting operation was set up. “A total of three suspects were arrested at Waterloo in Verulam. The arrested suspects were positively identified by the victim. One of the arrested suspects is a former employee,” said Mbele. The three men aged between 22 and 32 appeared in the Durban Magistrate’s Court on Friday facing charges of kidnapping, extortion and assault.
