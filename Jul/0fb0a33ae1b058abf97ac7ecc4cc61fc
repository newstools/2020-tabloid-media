Shortly after being shot in a shootout with police in Winston Park, a suspected carjacker was arrested in a local hospital where he was being treated for gunshot wounds, on Monday, 27 July. According to provincial police spokesperson, Captain Nqobile Gwala, it is alleged that on Monday at 1.30pm, a motorist was robbed of his vehicle on Sparks Road in Overport by three unknown armed men. “Police and a private security company were immediately alerted once the carjacking was reported. A chase ensued towards Jan Smuts Avenue and there was a shoot-out between the suspects and police. During the exchange of gunfire, the suspects lost control of the vehicle and collided with vehicles parked on the side of the road. They abandoned the vehicle on Jan Smuts Avenue and Chapel Drive and fled on foot,” Gwala said. She said that initial investigations conducted on the scene revealed that one of the suspects was injured. “Due to a concerted effort by the team, a 23-year-old suspect was located at a local hospital where he was being treated for gunshot wounds. He was positively identified and linked to the case. The suspect remains under police guard whilst at hospital. He will appear before the Durban Magistrate’s Court for carjacking once he is discharged from hospital,” Gwala added. The KwaZulu-Natal provincial commissioner, Lieutenant General Khombinkosi Jula welcomed the arrest of the suspect. “Criminals should know that police officers are stationed strategically to respond to reports of criminality in our province. I am confident that the outstanding suspects who managed to evade arrest will be caught. Investigations continue,” he said.
