A father is fighting for his life in hospital, his wife sustained serious injuries, and their baby was grazed by a bullet, after the family of three was caught in the crossfire between police and suspected hijackers, on Sheringham Road in Overport, last night (Thursday). Police spokesperson, Colonel Thembeka Mbele said: “It is alleged that last night (Thursday) at 19:20, police were conducting crime prevention duties when they received information of an intended hijacking in the area and proceeded to the scene. The five suspects spotted the police, opened fire towards them and the police returned fire. During this interchange of gunfire, the suspects jumped into their vehicle and fled the scene. After the suspects fled, police discovered a 29-year-old driver and his 27-year-old wife who had sustained gunshot wounds. They were taken to hospital for medical attention.” Messages calling for prayer for the family circulated on various social media platforms and stated that the husband was in a critical condition and had to undergo emergency surgery last night with a second operation today. It was further reported that the wife’s leg had been amputated while the baby was grazed by a bullet and was not in danger. Charges of attempted murder and carjacking were opened at Mayville police station for investigation.
