Social media has been flooded with women posting their images in a black and white filter recently, in order to allegedly “promote women empowerment”. This is a misconception as the idea is to showcase how easy it is for any woman to be featured in a black and white filter, across media platforms, as a result of femicide. Due to a “broken telephone” effect, the background of the challenge has been distorted while traveling over international waters before landing in Chatsworth. The challenge itself stemmed from the unfortunate cases of femicide in Turkey, which is something that South Africa is no stranger to. The American University Turkish Cultural Club cleared the air surrounding the challenge by saying: “Turkish people wake up every day to see a black and white photo of a woman who has been murdered on their Instagram feed, in their newspapers or on their television screens. The black and white photo challenge started as a way for women to raise their voice, to stand in solidarity with women we have lost and to show that one day, it could be their picture plastered across news outlets with a black and white filter.” Creator of social media online group #GirlCode, Chante LeTania Shanmogum of Croftdene, encourages women to stand in solidarity against femicide and to educate themselves about global initiatives. “As much as it is an amazing initiative that has intrigued a lot of women from all over the world to stand in this challenge, it is important to understand where this stems from rather than just jumping on the bandwagon,” she said. Shanmogum added that while the women who have participated in the challenge meant no harm, a better option would be to educate one another rather than sailing with the crowd. “Let’s actually make a difference. Let’s do a “My voice will be heard” challenge or a “We are your women” challenge, even a “Stand with us and stop GBV / Femicide” challenge and raise awareness in that way,” she said.
