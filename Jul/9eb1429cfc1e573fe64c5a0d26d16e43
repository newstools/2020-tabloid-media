“The storm is upon us. The surge in infections that we had been advised by our medical experts would come, has arrived. We are now recording over 12,000 new cases every day, equivalent of 500 new infections every hour. At least 4,079 people have died from Covid-19. A quarter of those who died passed away in the last week, “said President Cyril Ramaphosa. The president was addressing the nation on 12 July on progress in the national effort to contain the coronavirus (Covid-19) pandemic. He urged all to be “responsible, careful and compassionate.” He said that we are in the midst of a deadly pandemic and we must act accordingly however some people ignore the regulations by organising parties, drinking sprees, and walking around without masks. Some are attending funerals where the number of people exceeds the number 50. He said that “the virus is spread through carelessness and recklessness.”
Ramaphosa said that getting into a taxi without a face mask, gathering to meet friends, attending parties or even visiting family, can spread the virus and cost lives. “This may be a disease that is caused by a virus, but it is spread by human conduct and behavior,” said Ramaphosa.
We must change the course of this pandemic
Ramaphosa said that scientists have projected that South Africa may have between 40,000 and 50,000 deaths before the end of this year. “We must make it our single most important task to prove these projections wrong. Through our own actions we must change the course of this pandemic in our country,“ he said.
• Wear a cloth mask when leaving home.
• Wash hands with soap and water or sanitiser.
• Clean and sanitise surfaces in public spaces.
• Keep a safe distance – of at least 2 metres – from other people.
• Increase natural ventilation, avoid the recirculation of air
• Minimise the number of people sharing the same space. The virus may also be carried in tiny particles in the air
There is emerging evidence that the virus may also be carried in tiny particles in the air in places that are crowded, closed or have poor air circulation. We must improve the indoor environment of public places where the risk of infection is greatest. Measures taken to strengthen the health response:
• Over 37,000 quarantine beds
• 1,700 additional ventilators and companies in South Africa are producing 12,000 ventilators.
• Recruitment of additional nurses, doctors and emergency health personnel. Shortage exists of more than 12,000 health workers.
• Increasing the number of general ward and critical beds available for Covid-19 patients.
• Increase supplies of oxygen, ventilators for critical care,
• Rural patients to be referred to better-equipped urban centres.
• Employing more doctors and nurses and deploying volunteers
• Reduce the turnaround time for testing to no more than 48 hours.
• Introducing antibody testing for community-based surveillance
• Gender-based violence prevention programmes initiated at district level.
• Identify those who are infected and their close contacts and ensure that they immediately isolate.
• Deploying digital technologies to strengthen the identification, tracing and isolation of contacts. In several provinces, coronavirus test results are received via WhatsApp and details of contacts can be provided. Covid-19 positive cases should quarantine while waiting test results
• If one tests positive for coronavirus and have diabetes or hypertension and is short of breath, seek care at a hospital immediately.
The country will remain at alert level 3
• Wearing of cloth masks is mandatory.
• Taxis undertaking local trips permitted to increase capacity to 100 percent while long distance taxis not allowed to exceed 70 percent occupancy, on condition that protocols are followed i.e masks, vehicle sanitising and open windows.
• Auctions permitted subject to protocols similar to agricultural auctions.
• Parks are open for exercise, but not for gathering.
• Family visits and social activities are not allowed. The sale, dispensing and distribution of alcohol is suspended with immediate effect
Ramaphosa said that as we head towards the peak of infections, it is vital that we do not burden our clinics and hospitals with alcohol-related injuries. “In order to conserve hospital capacity, the sale, dispensing and distribution of alcohol is suspended with immediate effect. There is now clear evidence that the resumption of alcohol sales has resulted in substantial pressure being put on hospitals, trauma and ICU units, due to motor vehicle accidents, violence and trauma. Most of these occur at night,“ said the President. Curfew between 9pm and 4am effective Monday, 13 July at 9pm.
A curfew is in place between the hours of 9pm and 4am and will take effect from Monday, 13 July at 9pm. Apart from people who need to travel to and from work or who need to seek urgent medical, everyone will be required to remain at home. Cabinet has approved the extension of the National State of Disaster to 15 August 2020.

“There is no way that we can avoid the “coronavirus storm“ but we can limit the damage that it can cause to our lives. The difficulty, struggle and sacrifice of the past few months are about to get harder and our endurance will be sorely tested,” he said.
