A case of attempted murder is being investigated by Newlands East SAPS following the shooting of a police officer this afternoon (10 April) on Newlands West Drive. The police officer was in pursuit of a house robbery suspect when the shooting occurred at around 3.30pm. KwaZulu-Natal police spokesperson, Captain Nqobile Gwala, said: “It is alleged that today at 3.30pm, the police officers attended to a complainant of housebreaking. The suspect was found at the premises and during the scuffle between police officers and the suspect, a shot went off and struck a police officer on the right leg.” The suspect then fled heading toward Newlands West, where he was cut off and apprehended by other officers in pursuit. “Charges of attempted murder are being investigated by Newlands East SAPS.  The matter is still under investigation. The suspect was arrested,” Gwala said. At around 5pm Newlands West Drive was still closed to motorists as a forensic officer worked at the scene.
