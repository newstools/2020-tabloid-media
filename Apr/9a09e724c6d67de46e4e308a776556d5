Parents are feeling stressed about education.  Amidst the uncertainty of COVID-19, parents are worried about the future of education within South Africa.  Homeschooling has become a reality over the past few weeks, and parents have been feeling more stressed over the overall health, wellness and education for their children. Krsangi Radhe the founder of Sankalpa Coaching, who is an NLP Practitioner, Coach, Time-Line Therapist and Educator has therefore put together a free online program for mums to help them navigate through this difficult time.  The four live training sessions will allow mums a chance to attend this training virtually and ask questions to help them through whatever they are experiencing. Training 1 – Do you know your parenting style?Training 2 – Identifying your child’s love language?  Training 3 – Is your child left or right brain dominant?  What does that mean, when it comes to learning strategies?Training 4 – How to maintain self-care and care for your family at the same time. Based on the above topics – this will not only help families now, but way beyond the pandemic.  Whilst mums navigate through the deeper connections with children, this will also ensure a happier and stress-free home.  The time has come for parents to help their children and help themselves at the same time.  Develop these stronger bonds, and make relationships more fulfilling. By joining this training, mums will be setting themselves up for more self care and also to stand securely in engaging more mindfully both on an emotional and academic level with their children.To sign up for the free online training – send an email to : sankalpacoaching@gmail.com
