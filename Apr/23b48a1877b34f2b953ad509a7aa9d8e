To prevent the spread of Covid-19, the Umbumbulu Clinic, South of Durban is prioritising elderly patients who are collecting medication by taking their cards at the gate, collecting their medication, and thereafter sending them home immediately. Other patients are placed in a separate space at the entrance to assist in decongestion and keeps numbers to a minimum. This innovative measure by the clinic has been welcomed by the chairperson of the Portfolio Committee on Health, Dr Sibongiseni Dhlomo. “It was heart-warming listening to the operational manager of Umbumbulu clinic explaining what they are doing to prevent the elderly from mixing with other patients during this time of national disaster management,” said Dr Dhlomo. He said that he wanted to monitor how health facilities in his constituency are implementing government’s regulations on social distancing to curb the spread of the virus. According to Dr Dhlomo, he is happy to hear and see how the clinic has made changes in controlling the spread of Covid-19. The clinic has created a mini Central Chronic Medicines Dispensing and Distribution (CCMD) centre, to prevent patients from mixing with one another. “This is an innovation which the clinic needs to carry beyond Covid-19, so that the elderly, children and acute illnesses are not put in the same space”, said Dr Dhlomo.
