Chaos erupted on Albacore Crescent in Newlands East yesterday afternoon when residents and Metro Police officers clashed in a heated confrontation following two alleged assault incidents.  A Metro vehicle was damaged in the ruckus. Videos of the heated exchange circulated on social media as residents surrounded the Metro Police officers who reportedly called for back-up in view of the volatile situation. According to a voicenote shared on WhatsApp, a local is heard stating that the Metro Police officers had been tracing a Datsun Go vehicle suspected to be an Uber car. The resident further claims that the Metro Police officers were assaulting the driver and residents came out of their homes to investigate the commotion. The unknown local said residents slammed the assault and wanted the Metro Police officers to stop. A local woman was allegedly recording the assault and the resident claimed the Metro Police officers grabbed the phone from her causing her injury. This apparently caused her boyfriend to lash out at the officers in blue. The altercation had the whole neighbourhood out on the roadside with the police officers surrounded at which point more Metro Police officers were called to assist. Residents can be heard screaming and berating the Metro Police officers with vulgarities while accusing them of assaulting an innocent woman.  The woman is heard stating that she was not assaulted but a Metro officer tried to grab her cellphone and called her a ‘b#h.’ It was reported that the altercation simmered down eventually. Metro Police head, Commander Steve Middleton, said three people were arrested following the incident and added that the Metro Police officers were set up while doing their job. Information circulating further alleges that the motorist was pursued by Metro Police, allegedly from Pinetown.
