The management of Vawdas Interiors in Verulam, has lambasted the residents for circulating false news that their staff have tested positive for coronavirus. Tabloid Newspapers has seen the post saying “14 out of 20 workers from the company were infected with the coronavirus (Covid-19) “. The post also indicates that the company’s boss had contracted the virus. Speaking to Tabloid Newspapers, Ridwaan Vawda, the company’s financial manager, said that they were disappointed at the residents posting false news on social media without verification. He said: “We have been working tirelessly to put a stop to the rumours. We have 80 workers not 20. Not one of them has tested positive or showed symptoms of the virus,” he said. Vawda revealed that the only person who had tested positive for the coronavirus was their boss. He said: “It is alleged that the boss was in contact with an infected person. He tested positive a few days before the nationwide lockdown.” Vawda added that the boss had not travelled to overseas this year. Captain Henry Kisten, spokesperson for Verulam SAPS, warned the residents against spreading false information. He said that those circulating false news about people being infected with coronavirus will be arrested and charged accordingly. In a separate incident, a 32-year-old man was arrested last Sunday at his Phoenix home for charges of contravention of the Disaster Management Act. It is alleged that the accused made two flyers which he distributed on social media claiming that his 23-year-old former girlfriend and her teenage brother were infected with the pandemic virus. Natasha Ramkisson-Kara, provincial spokesperson for National Prosecuting Authority (NPA), said that the matter was not enrolled at court yet , as further investigations are required. She added that the man was released.
