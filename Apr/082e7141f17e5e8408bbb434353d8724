Three national chain supermarkets in Ladysmith , were ordered to close their stores, this afternoon 15 April by members of the Alfred Duma Municipality and SAPS, after the supermarkets allegedly did not follow lock-down regulations. It is reported that the supermarkets had allegedly been selling cooked meals from their deli’s. Other reports were that there were too many shoppers in the stories and were not following the social distancing regulations. Customers who had been standing in line were asked to go home. The supermarkets were closed for the rest of the afternoon and will be open again tomorrow. A motor-vehicle parts shop was also closed by police after they were found to be trading today. Ladysmith was busy with shoppers, as teachers and public servants got their salaries today.  Banks and most shops were over crowded and no social distancing was being followed.
