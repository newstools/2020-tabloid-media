Ladysmith Police have opened an inquest, after a 16-week-old foetus was found in Steadville, Emagogweni, this morning, 13 April. Ladysmith police and a forensic team was called to the rural area, after family members had made the gruesome discovery in the back yard, next to a bucket. “First, I could not say what it was, but after a closer look, you could see it was a small baby,” said one of the residents in the home. Despite efforts by the police, family members in the home refused to talk to the police.  Police are currently questioning three pregnant women from the household and they will be taken to the local provincial hospital for a medical check up. It is not clear if the foetus had been aborted or if it had been a miscarriage, but the post mortem would be able to say. “If the lungs were filled with air, then police will change their inquest to murder and further investigations will be carried out ,” said officials on the scene.
