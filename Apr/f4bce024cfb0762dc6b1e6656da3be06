About 300 staff members from Wentworth Hospital have downed tools and are protesting following an alleged shortage of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) at the hospital. It is believed that the protest commenced on Monday, 6 April. Community members are afraid that the protest could spread to other hospitals and they could be left helpless if there is no healthcare staff to treat them. Speaking to Tabloid Newspapers, patients who visited the hospital and spoke on condition of anonymity, said that the nursing staff has been striking since Monday. “Elderly patients who were sitting outside in the cold weather conditions said that they had no choice but to wait because they required treatment and medication.” Community activist in the Durban South area, Sharin Rajman said, “We need to appreciate the frontline healthcare workers who are risking their lives to save ours, so let’s be tolerant. The Department of Health should supply them with full PPE as it is imperative that they are properly attired so that they don’t risk their lives. The hospital PRO should be assisting the elderly patients and listening to their challenges.” Rajman said, as community activists they don’t mind assisting in dropping off chronic medication to the elderly during lockdown. She said that she will be in contact with the chairperson from the board to discuss arrangements for medication drop offs for senior citizens. Meanwhile transport has been arranged free of charge for senior citizens to go shopping at the Merebank Mall on Fridays from 9am to 11am. The taxi will do pick-ups from their usual route.
