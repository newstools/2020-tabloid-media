As a result of the restrictions implemented by government during the nationwide lockdown to prevent the spread of Covid-19, the Sathya Sai Sudha Mandir, in Chatsworth, informs their devotees that their annual Ammen Prayer will no longer be taking place on Good Friday. The temple, which has been hosting this prayer on Good Friday for the last 47 years, agrees that the situation is out of their control and pledges their cooperation by abiding by the laws of the land during the lockdown. “As spiritual aspirants, we also have to understand that there is a reason for everything that happens. However, it pains us to see the extent of the suffering that the virus is causing around the world,” said chairperson of the Sathya Sai Sudha Foundation Trust, Dhanpal Naidoo. Members of the Mandir believe that sincere love and prayer with faith is the surest way of attracting the attention of the Higher Beings. “We encourage all devotees to unite and request them to soak a cup of mealie (maize) meal on Monday, 6 April, and leave it at their prayer place. Thereafter, on Friday, 10 April, to cook the mealie (maize) meal into a porridge along with any vegetable curries of their choice and offer it to the Divine Mother,” said Naidoo. In order for this to be a collective effort, devotees are urged to offer their prayer, along with their family, to the deity at their homes at 11am on Good Friday, 10 April. “Hindu scriptures relate many stories from the past, where the Divine Mother had manifested Herself in response to the plea from Her children. We are convinced that She will answer our united plea and assist in bringing worldwide relief from the coronavirus outbreak,” said Naidoo.
