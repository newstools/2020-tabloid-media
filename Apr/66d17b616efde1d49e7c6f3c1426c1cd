Two suspects, 32 and 34, will appear in the Pongola Magistrate’s Court on Tuesday for possession after police uncovered 30 concealed packets of dagga inside a coffin. The two had claimed that they were transporting a corpse when they were stopped at a police roadblock. Police were manning a roadblock on the N2 freeway, when they noticed an approaching vehicle that had stopped and switched off its lights a short distance ahead of the roadblock. When police approached the vehicle they found two men inside, who claimed that they were from a funeral parlour and were transporting a corpse. Police conducted a search and about 80 kilograms of dagga was found inside the coffin. The KwaZulu-Natal provincial commissioner, Lieutenant General Khombinkosi Jula commended the police for their alertness and persistence to maintain law and order which led to the arrest of the suspects and the recovery of the dagga.
