The Uthukela District Municipality Covid-19 Command Centre led by the District Mayor Councillor Mazibuko, was alerted to a factory based in Pieters that was not observing the lockdown regulations. The team, comprising stakeholders Alfred Duma Speaker Councillor  Ngubane, SAPS, Department of Health and organised labour visited the factory on Monday afternoon, 30 March. On arrival they found the factory was in full operation. When the team questioned why they were operating during the lockdown period, the manager told them that they fall under the essential services category. The employer made arrangements to operate, without following regulations to house about 39 workers at their own free will. According to uThukela officials, these workers were accommodated in appalling conditions. There were no sanitizers available and the masks provided were not complying with safety regulations. As much as the factory had been accredited as essential services, it was not compliant with hygiene standards. The factory was ordered to stop operating and close, due to non-compliance with the Health and Safety Act. Transport was arranged to take the workers home and management was asked to get their ‘house in order’ and would only be allowed to carry on with its operations once these regulations had been met.
