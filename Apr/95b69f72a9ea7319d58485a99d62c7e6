Flamingo Heights residents in Tongaat, were left shocked by the bush knife fight that took place in broad daylight on Monday, 13 April. Video footage taken by a resident in the area, showed two men attacking each other with a bush knife and acane stick, outside a building while residents looked on. Residents who spoke to Tabloid Newspapers claimed that the fight started after a man wearing a red t-shirt allegedly stole a cellphone. They said the man in the blue t-shirt was badly injured as he was hacked with the bush knife on his left hand. Adil Pillay, a resident, said that they were shocked by the incident, especially as it happened during lockdown. “Upon arrival on the scene, we thought the two men were fighting for something big. But I was shocked to hear that the fight was initiated by a stolen cellphone,” he said. He expressed his disappointment of the men who almost killed each other for a cellphone. Pillay added that he knew the men from the area. Another resident, Shantal Naidu, lambasted the fighters and residents for disregarding the lockdown and measures that were instituted to curb the spread of the coronavirus. “The whole incident was embarrassing. Fighters should have phoned the police to deal with the issue of the stolen cellphone. It wasn’t supposed to be this way,” she said. Captain Patrick Ngwane, Tongaat SAPS spokesperson, condemned the incident, saying that no case has been opened by the fighters.
