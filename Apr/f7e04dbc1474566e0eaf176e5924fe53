The second phase of the mass screening for COVID-19 in Newcastle has started. Healthcare workers took to the streets in Fernwood and Sunset View in Newcastle, making their way down to Lennoxton  to inform residents about the spread of the Coronavirus and to screen them. Screening consisted of four main questions: Residents came out of their houses standing at their gates in apprehension.“When you see things like this you cant help but automatically be a bit frightened, even though you know that you do not have the virus, there is always a risk of contracting it,” said Vinesh Sukraj of Fernwood. Screening is a process. One that begins with the invitation to participate and ends with treatment for appropriately identified individuals identified by the screening test as being high risk. The Govt has also said that over the next two weeks, it would shift gear from passive case finding to active case detection. Until now most of the testing has been confined to individuals who may have been in contact with people who tested positive or had traveled overseas before officials implemented a travel ban in the middle of March.As of recent, the mass screening and testing “army” will conduct targeted and focused testing with a high risk of flare ups.“ I welcome the efforts that our mayor and president are making to flatten the curve,” said one resident. “However , I found some of the healthcare workers to be very rude and abrupt, one of them was walking around eating yoghurt and grapes while conducting the screening,” he saidAt the time of going to press the health department were not available for comment despite numerous calls.
