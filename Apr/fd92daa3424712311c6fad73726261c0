The Covid-19 outbreak is an unprecedented global health challenge and as at yesterday, 31 March,  the death toll in South Africa is 5, with 1353 positive cases and the number increasing daily. Newcastle residents have voiced their concern about people in the community not abiding by the rules. As the nation entered the first week of lockdown, the President Cyril Ramaphosa, addressed the nation on Monday night (30 March). He thanked South Africans for adhering to the regulations of the lockdown.  He also stated that he was concerned about those who have not understood the seriousness of the pandemic.  He called on citizens to stay at home for the remainder of the lockdown and to leave home only for essentials. Elmarie Mare, a long time Newcastle resident said: “I went to a grocery store this morning to get some essentials and nearly suffocated myself with my thick mask. I noticed that majority of the customers did not wear masks. None of the workers had masks on. It is scary how ignorant people are. They are oblivious to the fact that everyone is in danger and not just the elderly,”  Mare, whose daughter is a teacher in South Korea said that hand washing was the number one rule in the county. “My daughter came back from Korea five weeks ago and she is very strict concerning the wearing of masks. When the outbreak started in South Korea, all teachers and children at the school wore masks and had to wash their hands. None of the teachers and children got the virus. Schools have been closed since 21 February.” Another Newcastle resident claimed that he also had a similar experience. “It feels as if the lockdown is over. People are walking around as if it is a holiday. They are not enforcing the rule of social distancing. Can they not see what is happening around the world. The only way to flatten the curve of this virus is to abide by the rules of the lockdown and stay at home,” added the resident.
