Easylyn Young and her team  have been kept very busy during the lockdown period.With coordinating donations, collection and delivery of meals to senior citizens, the Sydenham Senior Citizens Task Team have been assisting at the Stranraer Old Age Home on Randles Road. Micaela Lambert, Farhana Malek and Pragasen Nadarajen have been feeding the elderly, destitute and neglected and doing hospital trips to make sure that they are not forgotten during this time of need. Young said it has not been easy for her, especially because her mother, 93, was recently admitted to hospital. “During lockdown, we have been locked out of the hospital; no visiting allowed. This is worse than a blow in the solar-plexus; we did not think of this possibility when we were faced with the lockdown,” said Young. She said that she has had to put aside her personal issues to help others.Young also has a son in the United States and at this time it is doubly difficult for her. She added that she trusts in God for his divine intervention at this time. Young said she would like to thank the team, the meal sponsors and everyone who is doing good work for the elderly, vulnerable and neglected. “Continue the good work and play your part in the community,” Young said.
