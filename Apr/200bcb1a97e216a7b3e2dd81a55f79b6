Political parties in KwaZulu-Natal have urged needy community members to apply for assistance with groceries through the Social Relief of Distress (SRD) fund, provided they meet the criteria. Les Govender, Inkatha Freedom Party Member of the Provincial Legislature (MPL) and Councillor Stanley Moonsamy from the Phoenix ANC office have called for the needy to apply for assistance during the Covid-19 lockdown. Govender said that the relief managed by the South African Social Security Agency (SASSA) will assist those who are in need with food hampers, during the state imposed Covid-19 lockdown.  “There is no doubt that the imposed national lockdown has greatly affected the poorest among us especially those who receive no social relief. As we go deeper into the lockdown, people without any form of income are becoming more desperate for the basic necessities.” Govender, who is also the IFP spokesperson on social development in KZN, said SASSA has implemented a relief mechanism to assist vulnerable people and alleviate their plight. According to the agency, in order to qualify for the SRD grocery hamper, one has to meet a certain criteria. Criteria: •   Sassa will give preference to grant beneficiaries who did not receive their grants for April. 
•   Where a temporary disability grant lapsed in March and the beneficiary could not get to an office to re-apply
•   If a beneficiary is still unable to work 
•   Where the beneficiary was defrauded of their grant
•   Those who have no income and they reside at home. The SRD does not apply to those in the temporary shelters or at facilities where meals are provided. “SASSA officials will take your details and people who qualify will be contacted and informed of a pick-up point nearest their homes, in keeping with the national call for people not to leave their homes unnecessarily. This is done on a month-to-month basis and people will have to re-apply each month,” Govender said. Councillor Moonsamy said that the Department of Social Development reported at the Covid-19 Local Command meeting on Monday, 13 April, that there has been a huge demand for food parcels by the community which has resulted in the Department being unable to verify individuals that qualify. He said that a new system has been developed, which must be followed by community members that require food parcels.When the community member applies for food parcels, the names and details of the applicant will then be screened and verified with SASSA to ascertain if the individual qualifies. All the previous lists developed by Councillors will not be applicable anymore and the Department of Social Development will advise on any further developments on this matter,” said Councillor Moonsamy. People who meet the above criteria may use the following contact numbers to apply for Social Relief of Distress by calling the National Call Centre 0800601011, or KZN office 033 846 3300 or WhatsApp: 071 607 1514 (send a message)
