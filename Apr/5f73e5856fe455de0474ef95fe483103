Tongaat police are investigating an inquest following the gruesome discovery of a fisherman’s body afloat at Dundley Pringle Dam on Sunday morning, 5 April. Captain Patrick Ngwane, Tongaat police spokesman, said that it is alleged that the fisherman fell off his makeshift raft on Friday. “Tireless work from the members of IPSS Medicals Search and Rescue (SAR) division, together with SAPS divers, Durban Metro Police, Durban and Umhlali K9 SAR, NSRI station 41 and Tongaat Community Emergency and Rescue led to the recovery of the body. An inquest has been opened and detectives are investigating the case,” he said. Ngwane told Tabloid Newspapers that the body was taken to Phoenix government mortuary for a post mortem. Paul Herbst, of IPSS Medical Search and Rescue, said that teams created a pathway through the dense floating hyacinth weed to launch a vessel to assist in search efforts. He said: “K9 Dante and K9 Ghost were utilised in the search for the fisherman. A short while into the second day of the search, K9 Dante located the body of the fisherman partially submerged, entangled in gill nets.” Herbst added that the body was handed over to authorities.
