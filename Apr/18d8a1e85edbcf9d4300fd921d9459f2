The Verulam SAPS have arrested 65 people for failing to stay in their homes during the 21 day nationwide lockdown. This, after the police  conducted roadblocks and searches on the streets to clamp down on lawbreakers. Empowered by section 27 of the Disaster Management Act (DMA), the police are hard at work, doing everything in their power to enforce the law during the nationwide lockdown. The Act provides for an integrated and coordinated disaster management policy in South Africa that enforces preventing and reducing the risk of disasters, mitigating the severity of disasters, emergency preparedness, rapid and effective response to disasters and post-disaster recovery. Captain Henry Kisten, spokesperson for Verulam SAPS told Tabloid Newspapers that they have arrested 65 people for failing to stay at home during the lockdown. He said that a large number of the suspects were caught consuming alcohol in public areas. Kisten said the accused had appeared before the Verulam Magistrate’s Court. “Large quantities of liquor were seized and destroyed.  Roadblocks are being set up randomly at all entrances and exits of Verulam vicinity. We have a helicopter providing information to law enforcement of any gatherings in residential areas,” he said. Kisten added that more arrests are expected as residents violate the measures put in place by government to avoid the spread of the coronavirus pandemic.
