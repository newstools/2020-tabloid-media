The Durban Hub of the Global Shapers network have partnered up with eThekwini Municipality and The Durban Edge to create a Covid-19 business portal. The portal includes resources to help businesses get access to the right information during the Covid-19 pandemic. Staying true to the organisation’s vision of believing that young people are the key element in solution building, policy-making and lasting change, the Durban Hub had the interests of the City’s businesses at heart while creating the platform for businesses to access accurate information from a reliable source to plan for the future. On the website, one can access national and global statistics, together with local repercussions as well as graphs that give a visual representation of the spread of the pandemic.“We are thinking for our City and also learning from the best practices from different cities worldwide,” said Tamryn Iyer, a member of the organisation. The Durban Hub takes pride in promoting collaboration using their varied skills and experiences to ensure that they are an effective platform for the Durban community. In addition to the sea of information on the website, there are also important links such as a link to a Covid-19 self-screening tool and a link to the Durban Chambers Business Impact Survey.The information can be accessed on https://bit.ly/DurbanCOVID-19
