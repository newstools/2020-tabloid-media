The University of KwaZulu-Natal (UKZN), like many other Universities in South Africa has been impacted by the national lockdown regulations enforced to curb the spread of the coronavirus (Covid-19). The University Management issued a statement on 9 April, addressing the issue further. Ms Normah Zondo, the acting Executive Director: Corporate Relations Division said that UKZN is working to guard against further loss of teaching time to ensure that the academic program continues. The statement further read: “We are suddenly in a changed world to which we must adapt quickly. The Covid-19 pandemic has delivered a crisis, but we still have room for maneuver—a chance to realise our ambitions by mobilising our resources and acting swiftly and creatively.” Zondo explained: “ Due to the lockdown extension, UKZN is exploring and planning for multiple scenarios with regard to the resumption of the currently suspended academic program. All the scenarios considered are guided by the need to act against the possibility of losing a portion of the academic year or extending the academic year beyond December 2020.”
 
Zondo said that the commencement of online learning will be decided on following further discussions and consultations with the student community. In the meantime, UKZN have initiated a process to transfer all academic course material onto virtual platforms, for completion at the end of April 2020. 
 
“Every effort will be made to ensure that UKZN find creative solutions to overcome issues around access to technological devices as we progress our online strategy,” concluded Zondo.
