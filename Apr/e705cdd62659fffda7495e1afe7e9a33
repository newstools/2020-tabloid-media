A Phoenix resident who works for a store in Durban, together with other staff members of the same store were tested for the coronavirus last week. Ward 49 Councillor, Tino Pillay said: “A Phoenix family has come forward and confirmed that the husband who was tested last week is Covid-19 positive. The husband has since been self-isolating in his home. I was informed about this case via concerned neighbours and immediately made contact with the family who confirmed this to be true, ” said Pillay. “A specialised team is going out today to the effected family to test the wife and children. The Health Department will do the necessary as all protocols have been adhered to. Neighbours will also be tested as a precautionary measure, ” said Councillor  Pillay. Pillay advised the community to treat this pandemic as serious as it is,  and to please stay indoors at all times. “Panic is a normal reaction but if we comply with the lockdown regulations we have nothing to fear. I pray that the family gets the attention they need to overcome the coronavirus virus, ” added Councillor Pillay.This is a developing story and updates will follow once new information becomes available.
