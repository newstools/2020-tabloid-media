A group of 20 university students, which includes some girls from St Mary’s DSG Kloof who were part of the matric Class of 2019, have offered to spend their time assisting this year’s matriculants with school work during lockdown. The leader of the group, Kayla Fields said she came up with the idea of offering tutoring sessions on WhatsApp and via zoom calls after her family and friends in matric requested her assistance. “I wrote matric last year so I know that it is very hard under normal circumstances. I can only imagine how hard it must be for the current matrics during this lockdown. I ran the idea past a few good friends of mine. They were more than happy to offer their services,” said Kayla. The group of friends immediately started with the tutoring, after posting an invite to the class of 2020 on the St Mary’s DSG Kloof Facebook page. Kayla says it’s only been two days and the turnout has been good. Trent Liford who is also assisting with tutoring said: “We have received responses from pupils who need help with history, geography, accounting, maths literacy and business studies.” Trent said the tutoring is free. “We thought of the matrics undergoing stress, having to basically teach themselves the syllabus. We knew quite a few of them were struggling and that is why we offered to help,” said Trent. “The way the tutoring works is that students will send us any questions or concepts they do not understand and one of the tutors will either help the student over Whatsapp or organise a time to hold a zoom call to go through the work. The response has been fantastic so far with many students asking for our help,” added Trent. Both Kayla and Trent have extended their offer to assist any matric pupil who needs help during lockdown.
