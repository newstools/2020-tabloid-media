Thirteen men and three women were arrested in Merewent yesterday (Monday, 6 April) and will appear in Wentworth Court today after Metro Police clamped down on them for violating the national lockdown regulations. Wentworth SAPS communications officer, Captain MP Gumede, said, “Metro Police were conducting operations in Merewent yesterday and enforcement was done on the Disaster Management Act, checking on permits and people walking on the road aimlessly and without permits. Thirteen males and three females were arrested for failing to remain in their residence during the Covid-19 lockdown mandate from the State President.” The arrested people were detained in custody and will appear in Wentworth Court this morning. The police have been patrolling the area urging community to stay indoors during this lockdown, but some are not complying with the call made by the State President, Cyril Ramaphosa,” Captain Gumede added. “The tuck shops were also visited to check whether the owners are in compliance or not. Some tuck shops have been charged for selling cigarettes and other items which they are not supposed to sell. Parents are urged to monitor their children during this lockdown since the little ones are still seen playing outside on the roads. Children are susceptible to pick up the virus if not monitored closely,” Captain Gumede said. “Some people are taking this lockdown for granted but it is for their own protection and health. The police will continue with their duties and also enforce the law on those who are not in compliance. The police are not harassing anyone but are adhering to the State President’s call by performing legal duties in ensuring the safety of our community,” said Gumede.
