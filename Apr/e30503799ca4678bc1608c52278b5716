eThekwini Municipality Mayor, Mxolisi Kaunda, has confirmed that there are new confirmed Covid-19 cases in the biggest townships of Durban. Kaunda made the announcement at a media briefing that was held at the Glebelands hostel in uMlazi on Thursday, 02 April, to raise awareness about the deadly virus and to urge residents to adhere to lockdown regulations. During the briefing, Kaunda mentioned that there were new confirmed cases in the three biggest townships, which are  KwaMashu, Inanda and uMlazi but did not give any further details. “The municipality has taken a tough stance against the spread of the virus and has implemented safety interventions at rental housing units, transit camps, informal settlements and hostels,” he said. Kaunda said the visit to Glebelands was a wake-up call after a women, 45, who worked at Platt Drive Primary School in Isipingo had tested positive on the deadly virus and sadly died  early this week. “A grade nine pupil from uMlazi has also tested positive. It is believed that the pupil was close to the teacher and we have also found out that one of the family members of the deceased has also tested positive as well,” he said. “The department is busy identifying the people who have been in contact with those who had tested positive,” he added. During his walkabout in Glebelands Hostel in Umlazi and Dakota informal settlement in Isipingo, both south of the city Kaunda distributed pamphlets, hand sanitisers and soap. “This intervention is to raise awareness in the township and also to ensure residents are supplied with sanitisers and soap to prevent the spread of the virus,” said Kaunda.   Kaunda said they are also working hard to mitigate the spread of the virus to the homeless, who run into thousands in the city.
