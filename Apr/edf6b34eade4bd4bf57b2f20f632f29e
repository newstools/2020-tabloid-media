Local fitness guru, Adele Macdonald has put her fitness ‘thinking’ cap on and wants to share a few fitness tips on how to keep active and sane during the extended days of lock down. “You really don’t need gym equipment and all the specialised goodies to stay sane, healthy and fit,” said Adele.  In her daily full body routine, Adele has used shoes in a plastic bag and a chair. “You can decided on the weight you want to lift, by adding more shoes into the bag.”  In the attached video, Adele starts off with 3X10 reps with this easy to follow cardio full body work-out. “The exercises are easy to follow and will give your heart rate the much needed kick start” added Adele. “Things can get a little stressful at home, if you tend to sit in a corner and over think life, so to keep our minds and body busy I volunteered to help with some home workouts”, said Adele.
 Adele is encouraging everyone to get involved and to take part in getting a little fitness done at home, with things that is already in your home. “Everyone benefits from exercise, regardless of age, sex or physical ability. Regular exercise helps prevent or manage many health problems and concerns. Exercise improves mood, it boosts energy, promotes better sleep and best of all it can be fun. When your heart and lung health improve, you have more energy to tackle daily chores,” Adele added. Adele also added that a few minutes of slow stretch before each workout can be done. “Everyday you can motivate yourself, by increasing your reps per exercise”, she said.
 Adele told the Ladysmith Herald, that  each week she will provide a short clip and explanation and hopes that this will help kill the long hours in lock down and improve our mental and physical outlook in these extremely different and difficult days.
 “Please stay healthy and safe during this period of lockdown and lets help our leaders, by staying at home to flatten the curve,” added Adele.
