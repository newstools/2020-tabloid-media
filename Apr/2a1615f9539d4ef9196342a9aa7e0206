The Health Minister, Dr Zweli Mkhize announced that the total number of confirmed Covid-19 cases in South Africa is 2003 as at Friday, 10 April.  This is an increase of 69 new cases. The total Covid-19 cases recovered are 410. The total number of Covid-19 tests conducted to date is 73028.  The number of Covid-19 deaths is 24.  Dr Mkhize said that the majority of deaths occurred with people who had pre-existing conditions and the real cause of death may have been that pre-existing conditions. Provincial Breakdown Masks Mkhize said that face-masks are recommended as an addition to hand-washing and social distancing. The face mask should never be promoted as our primary prevention strategy and should never be promoted separately from hand-washing and social distancing. To ensure that N95 masks and surgical masks are secured for workers who really need them, he recommends that the cloth face-mask should be used by the general population. Mkhize said that there is sufficient scientific evidence to show that the cloth face mask significantly reduces the amount of virus that can be emitted. It is nevertheless important to observe basic rules of the use of cloth face masks to ensure that they are safe for use: • The face-mask must cover the nose and mouth completely.
• Face-masks should not be lowered when speaking, coughing or sneezing.
• Face-masks should never be touched – fidgeting with the mask repeatedly is strongly
discouraged as it is important to avoid touching the face with hands. The inner side of the mask should not be touched by hands.
• Wash hands before and after donning or removing the face-mask.
• Wash cloth face-masks with warm soapy water and iron when dry. Ironing assists with decontamination
• Change your cloth face mask if it is wet or visibly soiled
• Each person will need to have at least 2 face-masks so that one face-mask is available when the other is being washed.
