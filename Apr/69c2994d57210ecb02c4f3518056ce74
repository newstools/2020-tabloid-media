An investigation is underway to determine the cause of the blaze that tore through Bambazi High School on Wednesday, 8 April.  The school, which is situated in Bergville, is alleged to have been vandalized and torched by arsonists, set on derailing the rest of the school year. KwaZulu-Natal Education MEC, Kwazi Mshengu, said that he was shocked by the incident and has called for an immediate investigation. He said: “We are definitely going to investigate this and as a department we call on anyone who may have information that could assist the investigation to come forward and present such information to the authorities.” According to the school principal, one classroom was badly destroyed while other classrooms were slightly affected. Community members raised the alarm when they saw smoke bellowing and fire coming out the school windows. The fire department was immediately called and the inferno took some hours to subside. Mshengu has called on anyone with information on the incident to come forward.  He said: “We once again urge all sectors of society to cooperate with us in ensuring that schools are protected at all cost.”
