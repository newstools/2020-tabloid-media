The Minister of Transport, Fikile Mbalula, has announced a dramatic drop in road fatalities over the Easter weekend. Mbalula said the lockdown assisted in bringing the fatalities down by 70 percent as he released the Easter Weekend Traffic Statistics on the N1 South Grasmere, this morning. Mbalula said that all together 26 people lost their lives, between 9 and 13 April, in 28 crashes. He said that this is a massive drop when compared to the 2019 Easter long-weekend. In 2019 the Easter weekend fell on 18 to 21 April, and there were 80 fatal crashes reported throughout South Africa that resulted in the loss of 104 lives. KwaZulu-Natal accounted for 26 of those fatalities and Limpopo lead with a total of 27 people killed in road accidents. This year, KZN had six fatalities resulting from five crashes. In the report Mbalula said the number of drunk drivers was also reduced to 11 while more than 700 people were arrested for the violation of road traffic laws and one other for exceeding the speed limit.
