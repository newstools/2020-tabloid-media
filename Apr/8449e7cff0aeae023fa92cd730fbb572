Seven dialysis patients at the separate dialysis centre at St Augustine’s Hospital have tested positive for COVID-19 and will have to be swiftly relocated to continue their critical treatment.KwaZulu-Natal Health MEC Nomagugu Simelane-Zulu confirmed the situation at a media briefing on Sunday. According to the MEC there is ward or building in St Augustine’s Hospital that is being used as a dialysis centre but is separate from the main building.“Although we raised an issue with the group to say how sure are they that the virus has not moved around, they indicated it was not possible for the virus to move around, as the healthcare workers that work in the hospital don’t necessarily work in the dialysis centre,” Simelane-Zulu said in media reports.She added that the dialysis centre was allowed to continue functioning in view of the shortage of dialysis centres in the province and taking into consideration that it is a separate building from the facility.“I must indicate that as of Wednesday we were informed that close to seven patients in that facility, have been found to be positive and we are now faced with a situation where we need to instruct and we have indicated to St Augustine’s that they must find alternative centres for these particular patients to be dialysed,” Simelane-Zulu said.She indicated that clinically it is not viable for dialysis patients to stop treatment and can run the risk of that person complicating and therefore passing away. The MEC said the hospital has instructed that all patients need to be tested.“We have given St Augustine’s Hospital a week to say what they are going to do with these patients,” Simelane-Zulu said.Currently, St Augustine’s Hospital has recorded 66 positive COVID-19 patients of which 48 were staff. Four patients who tested positive for COVID-19 demised at the hospital with one patient succumbing to the deadly virus after being transferred to another medical facility. Also, as a full investigation into the COVID-19 outbreak at Kingsway Hospital is underway, KwaZulu-Natal Health MEC Nomagugu Simelane-Zulu stated at a media briefing that 10 healthcare staffers at the medical facility have tested positive for the deadly virus. The hospital recently announced its temporary closure after a patient tested positive for COVID-19. Craig Murphy, regional director of Netcare’s coastal region said in a statement that the emergency department was closed for outpatients as of April 14 and a systematic deep cleaning and decontamination process was started immediately.  Meanwhile, Simelane-Zulu said there would be consequences if any negligence was found on the part of any individual at the hospital pending the outcome of the investigation.  She added that tests are continuing with results still being waited on.
