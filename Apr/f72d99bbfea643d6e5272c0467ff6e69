A 38-year-old woman who was admitted to the Mediclinic Newcastle did not die of a Covid-19 infection. This was confirmed by the hospital in a statement released late yesterday afternoon (Tuesday, 21 April). The woman was apparently admitted to hospital on 17 April and passed away the next day. The reason she was admitted to hospital was not disclosed however, due to of patient confidentiality. The hospital’s general manager, Japue Greyling said in the statement that two tests were conducted on the person and both were negative for the corona virus. It also confirmed that there were presently no confirmed Covid-19 cases at the facility. The hospital has admitted 54 suspected Covid-19 patients of which 53 tested negative while one was positive. The patient was discharged on 23 March. Greyling said that Mediclinic respects patient confidentiality and condemned a recent inaccurate media report that the patient died of the infection. “Patient confidentiality has been abused. The National Health Act of 2003 makes it an offense to disclose patient information,” he said. Greyling said in the statement that should there be any Covid-19 patients, medical support from Mediclinic would accommodate patients in an isolation unit where nursing staff are trained and equipped. “We continue to urge the public to take the necessary precautionary measures by practicing good hand hygiene, social distancing as well as adhering to lockdown requirements. We also require anyone experiencing symptoms of the virus such as shortness of breath, fever, sore throat and coughing who believe that they might have been exposed to please contact their healthcare provider,” said Greyling.
