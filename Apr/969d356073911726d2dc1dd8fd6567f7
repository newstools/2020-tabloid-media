A 26-year-old man accused of robbing a service station in Umhlatuzana on Tuesday, 14 April, has been arrested after allegedly returning to buy fuel for his getaway vehicle. The accused, who is due to appear at the Chatsworth Magistrate’s Court this week, is alleged to have held up employees at the Engen garage along Chatsworth Main Road at around 11.45pm, Tuesday night. According to police, the 26-year-old was armed with an object which resembled a firearm, when he robbed the service station. Brigadier Jay Naicker, KwaZulu-Natal police spokesperson, said: “The suspect demanded cash and stole an undisclosed amount of money before fleeing the scene in his getaway vehicle.” However his crime spree was short lived as the suspect was apprehended two hours later at the same service station, allegedly buying fuel. The suspect was recognised by Pro Secure officers, who were patrolling the area following the robbery. They detained the suspect and called Bayview SAPS, who effected the arrest. Naicker said that the suspect had arrived at the service station on foot after changing his clothing. He said: “The suspect attempted to purchase fuel at the service station. He was positively identified by witnesses at the scene and was placed under arrest by police officers. The vehicle used during the commission of crime was seized at the suspect’s house.” A search resulted in the recovery of a silicone gun and cash. The 26-year-old has been charged with robbery and detained at the Bayview police station. Naicker said he will be profiled to see if he is linked to other robberies and crimes in the area.
