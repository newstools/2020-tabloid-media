With the uncertainty of not knowing who will be effected by a Covid-19 infection, pregnant mothers and those who have given birth during lock down are in panic. What is supposed to be a time of happiness is now flooded with feelings of uncertainty that has left many expectant and new parents awake at night. With some ease of regulations for essentials, parents can now prepare for their newborn by at least getting clothing. For others the chances of their babies being infected is an recurring nightmare. The Ladysmith Herald, spoke to Mariska Burger, who is expecting her second baby in six weeks’ time. “To be pregnant during lockdown is the worst feeling I have ever experienced and the fear is eating away at me. Not only do I have to worry about how we are going to look after our new little person, but the risk of getting Covid-19 is a recurring thought that keeps me up most nights,” she said. She said that with the lockdown, her fiancé, and baby’s father, will not be able to be at the hospital for the birth. “He works for the Ladysmith police. My son and I remain in lockdown, but I see how my fiancé struggles to ask people to stay at home. He is not only worried about other people, but about his family and that he might bring it home and infect us.” Burger, who is expecting a little girl, said that it has been “a rather sad time” as family and friends cannot visit her and that they cannot share her excitement. “It has been a little overwhelming and a very emotional time because I had to be admitted to hospital for a few days as doctors were concerned that I might have the baby a little earlier. Those days were spent alone in hospital without the help and support from grandparents and fiancé,” said Burger. She said that she was doing much better after resting at home, adding that she and her family were trying hard to stay positive and are praying for strength and courage. “Not just for my family, but all of those that are facing this pandemic,” she said.
