Street Lit comprises of a dozen men and women from the city’s destitute, unemployed and vulnerable communities, most of them formerly homeless themselves.  All of the vendors are observing lockdown and are thus unable to currently earn anything. These vendors typically sell at public gatherings such as markets, festivals, events, creative spaces and retail outlets and depend on the sale of the books which provides a frugal income for all participants. This has, unfortunately, been enormously eroded due to the extension of the nationwide lockdown. In an effort to keep some income reaching the vendors, Anivesh Singh from Micromega Publications has come up with an innovative idea as the unabashed Covid-19 pandemic has smashed the momentum of the project. Singh has created an online platform which enables the public to support the Street Lit vendors by buying the books online. “We are fighting back and wanting to help. A selection of books is available for perusal online on www.madeinchatsworth.co.za,” said Singh. Books can be purchased now and picked up on the first Saturday after lock-down from Pick ‘n Pay Durban North. Alternative delivery arrangements can be made if necessary, and if infrastructure allows. One imagines that personal libraries of books are being read in homes across the city, and will need replenishing once the lockdown is over. The Street Lit vendors will be rearing to go to and delighted to sell their books to the public of Durban again with renewed vigour. In the mean time, supporters of Street Lit are encouraged to select and pay for their books online.
