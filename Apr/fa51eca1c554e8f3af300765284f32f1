The Coronavirus lockdown has not deterred criminals from targeting homes in Durban. Residents are advised by Blue Security to constantly remain alert while at home and to test or improve their security arrangements during this period, so as to remain safe. This advisory from Blue Security Tactical Ambassador for Umbilo and Durban North, Darrel Moodley, follows a spate of home invasions, housebreakings and some successful arrests in and around Durban during the Easter weekend. “Robberies are also being taken to the next level with victims being forced to provide digital information required for online cash transactions,” said Moodley. Blue Security Tactical Ambassador for Moseley and Queensburgh, Andre Engels said in Escombe on Easter Saturday, 11 April, armed suspects threatened a couple and their baby before ransacking and robbing their home. “The couple was at home when they noticed two men on the property, who then proceeded to hold them up at knifepoint before marshalling them into the bedroom and tying up the husband with computer cable,” said Engels.  Engels said the mother and her infant were not tied up, but were instructed to remain seated throughout the incident. “After ransacking the home, the suspects fled with two cellphones, jewellery, a nappy bag and a brush cutter. It is thought that the suspects gained access to the property by jumping over the back fence before walking through the front door which had been left open.  They escaped on foot into the bush at the rear of the property. Fortunately the victims were not injured in the incident and declined the offer of trauma counselling. “ Malvern SAPS attended the scene. No arrests have yet been made.  “Durban residents need to be extra vigilant when relaxing at home and to ensure that boundaries are monitored by effective alarm systems,” Engels said. “Alert neighbours, armed response service providers and the nearest SAPS branch should suspicious activity be observed,” Engels said.
