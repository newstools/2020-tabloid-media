Although KwaZulu-Natal is ranked third in the country with 671 cases of the coronavirus, inmates and officials of the province’s correctional centres are still left unaffected by the virus, thus far. However, nationally there has been a hike of nine more correctional service officials testing positive for the virus, increasing the unsolicited number of positive cases within correctional services to 94.  In a statement released by the Department of Correctional Services (DCS) spokesperson, Singabakho Nxumalo, it said that the nine new cases were from the Kutama Sinthumule Private Facility in Limpopo with its first case, Warmbokveld in the Western Cape with four cases and East London and Worcester recording two new cases each. Nxumalo mentioned that valuable lessons were learned from the positive cases confirmed in East London and that it would influence their disaster response plan moving forward.“All 27 inmates who were tested at St. Albans Correctional Centre are negative. As a result of this, East London remains as the only correctional facility to have inmates testing positive for the virus. The number of confirmed cases of the virus still remains at 56, ” said Nxumalo. He said: “As the number of infected cases increases in correctional services, the containment and treatment pillar of the Disaster Management Response Strategy of the department has been activated.  This means, looking at the rapid identification of laboratory-confirmed cases, the isolation of those who test positive and management of the pandemic within our centres,” said Nxumalo.  Nxumalo also confirmed that screening of officials and those accessing DCS premises remains as a measure to prevent the possible transmission of the virus and that decontamination is underway where positive cases have been reported.“It remains critical for all our officials to be vigilant in their activities outside of working hours and they must adhere to preventative measures including social distancing,” he said.
