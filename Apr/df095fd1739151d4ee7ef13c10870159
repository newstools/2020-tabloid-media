 As part of PCW’s programme to assist families with food relief during the lockdown, the organisation is assisting 5000 families and 30 NGO’s with much needed essentials over the period of the lockdown. Speaking to The Phoenix Tabloid vice president Mr Sham Maharaj stated, “We identified the 1000 beneficiaries through 20 NGO’s and respected leaders from the Phoenix and Inanda areas. Each beneficiary received one voucher and a slip indicating directions to the venue and time for them to arrive at the Phoenix Youth Centre to collect their hamper. A hundred beneficiaries arrived at the Youth Centre from 7am to 2.30pm in half hour intervals. Our co-ordinators were in constant contact with all beneficiaries to ensure the smooth running of this operation and that beneficiaries adhere to their times to collect hampers.” “As the beneficiaries arrived in batches of 100, their hands were sanitized and each beneficiary who did not have a face mask was given a mask, and thereafter they were escorted to a short queue in which people were standing 2 meters apart whilst waiting to collect their hampers. We had 30 volunteers to assist with queue management and social distancing，20 private security personnel with four vehicles，two Ambulances，a health and safety plan and the presence of SAPS,” said Maharaj. All the residents received their hampers and the ones that arrived early were also given refreshments and cakes to sustain them throughout the distribution. Maharaj added that close to a thousand other residents arrived at the Youth Centre without vouchers. “Their names and addresses were taken down by Childwelfare Officials and the residents were informed that hampers would be delivered to their homes as and when Childwelfare receives more donations of groceries from our donors,” said Maharaj.
