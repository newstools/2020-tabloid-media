The Durban Central SAPS is pleased with the stringent measures in place during the lockdown as instituted by President Cyril Ramaphosa, as this has had a positive impact on the crime rate, in and around Durban central. One of the measures which have led to the decrease in crime is ban on the sale of alcohol. According to eThekwini Central Cluster spokesperson, Captain Muzi Maphumulo, alcohol consumption was a major contributing factor to crime prior to the lockdown. “It is important to highlight that alcohol abuse is a major contributing factor to most criminal incidents, hence the regulations imposed as a result of the lockdown has minimised the opportunity for crime to emerge,” said Maphumulo. Maphumulo confirms that Durban Central SAPS are enforcing the strict regulations in relation to the Disaster Management Act and urges members of the public to report any contravention of the lockdown measures such as liquor outlets continuing with business as normal. “Durban Central SAPS and other eThekwini Central Cluster Police Stations are still operational during the lockdown period and any crime incidents or contravention of lockdown regulations should be immediately reported,” said Maphumulo. Maphumulo appealed to the community to abide by the lockdown regulations and to make sure that if essential workers are going to work, they should carry their permit and their identity documents.
