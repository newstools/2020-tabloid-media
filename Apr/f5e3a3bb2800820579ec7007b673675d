While thousands of keen cyclists sat at home pondering the aQuellé Tour Durban that would have taken place last weekend, the race’s title sponsor, aQuellé, stepped onto the top step of the podium with a massive donation to The Domino Foundation’s drive to provide relief aid hampers to vulnerable families and communities hit hard by the coronavirus lockdown. The Krantzkop-based water brand has donated all the products that they would have given to the various water tables and finishers to The Domino Foundation’s Disaster Response project that provides food, water and aid to disadvantaged communities north and south of Durban. The company’s marketing manager Suzelle Stegen said: “While we missed not being able to connect with all the riders, this actually addresses the main reason behind the aQuellé Tour Durban, supporting the Domino Foundation and making a difference in people’s lives. The motto of the aQuellé Tour Durban is Ride4Good, so for every participant that would have taken part we will donate a bottle of water to those in need.” The Domino Foundation’s Shaun Tait said: “It is an amazing gesture and a reflects the way that South Africans are pulling together to deal with the Covid-19 crisis. Water is such a fundamental commodity at this time, and the pallets of aQuellé that have arrived at our Disaster Response Distribution Centre will make a huge difference to the households that we are trying to assist, and hopefully put a smile on a lot of faces during this tough time. “If you want to be encouraged and get an idea of the work we have been able to do on the ground in collaboration with the KZN Response team please follow the COVID-19 Relief link on The Domino Foundation website,” said Tait. The race organisers have committed to postponing the race to later in the year, and will work with all the dates and rules laid down by government, provincial authorities and cycling administrators.
