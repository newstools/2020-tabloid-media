The KZN Government Health Department is ramping up the fight against COVID-19 and will commence community screening and testing in the UThukela District Municipality as from Wednesday, 8 April 2020. This is in line with the President and Minister Zweli Mkhize’s announcement that fieldworkers will commence with an active community screening and testing programme. With the number of positive COVID-19 cases spreading in communities, the risk to vulnerable communities is also increasing. Government health services are actively trying to find people who might need help through talking to people (screening) and thus to determine whether they need to go for testing so we can refer them for treatment.    Community screening and testing will start in the following targeted areas:    UThukela Alfred Duma, Ladysmith 08/04/2020 – Acaciavale Rose Park Close to Mosque 09/04/2020  10/04/2020   08/04/2020 – Steadville White City 09/04/2020  10/04/2020   13/04/2020 – Steadville Jabavu 14/04-15/04- 16/04-17/04    13/04/2020 – Umbulwane Area 1 14/04-15/04- 16/04-17/04 13/04/2020 – Umbulwane Area 2 14/04-15/04- 16/04-17/04    13/04/2020 – Watersmeet  14/04-15/04- 16/04-17/04   09/04/2020 – Ncinjane Area 14/04-15/04- 16/04-17/04   09/04/2020 – Magubane area  14/04-15/04- 16/04-17/04   09/04/2020 Somshoek area 14/04-15/04- 16/04-17/04         Inkosi Langalibalele, Estcourt 09/04/2020 – Emabhanoyini 14/04-15/04- 16/04-17/04    09/04/2020 – Zampumpu hostel and Khwezi 14/04-15/04- 16/04-17/04 Okhahlamba, Bergville 09/04/2020- Winterton Winery and Khethani 14/04-15/04- 16/04-17/0409/04/2020 – Woodford and Rookdale 14/04-15/04- 16/04-17/04  09/04/2020 – Dukuza and Sandlwane 14/04-15/04- 16/04-17/04   Community Health Care Workers will be provided with uniforms and identifiable tags which will make it easier for the community to identify them. Screening in other areas will be rolled out following the same phased and targeted approach. Screening is essential in this fight as it is a way for health workers to find out if you may have COVID-19 or not. Community Health Care Workers will refer persons suspected of having Coronavirus to the nearest community health centre, clinic or hospital.    Tests will only be conducted at health care facilities and mobile testing sites.  Not everyone will be tested. Health workers will use a formula by looking at how serious your symptoms are and what high risk factors you have. By working together we can flatten the curve of this pandemic. Also, by observing the regulations, staying at home and observing good hygiene practices we have a real chance of containing the spread.
