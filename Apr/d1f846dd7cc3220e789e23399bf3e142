Covid-19 testing on about 100 or more people allegedly displaying symptoms of the coronavirus is underway at a building on Dr Pixley KaSeme Street (West Street) in the Durban CBD, since this morning (Wednesday, 1 April). The Chinese-owned building was reported to the Department of Economic Development, Tourism and Environmental Affairs citing that inhabitants in the building are sick and reportedly exhibiting coronavirus-like symptoms prompting officials to institute a raid. According to Economic Development MEC, Nomusa Dube-Ncube, the complainant made serious allegations. “I mean a serious complaint,” she said. The MEC said she briefed the KwaZulu-Natal police commissioner and national leadership who consequently deployed intelligence operatives and they uncovered shocking information. “This morning at around 00h12, the whole building was locked down by law enforcement agencies. We had pre-raid briefings involving all law enforcement agencies and health professionals from the Department of Health.
 A decision was made that before a raid could be conducted, safety measures should be put in place and that people who live in the building be subjected to intensive screening,” Dube-Ncube said.
 Officials from the Department of Health and Labour as well as scores of police officers were on site attired in protective gear as the screening and investigation continues. At this stage, the number of occupants in the building is unknown. 
Currently, the Covid-19 statistics in South Africa, stands at 1353 positive cases with five reported deaths.
