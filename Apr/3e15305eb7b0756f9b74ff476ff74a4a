Life is slowly returning to normal for licenced informal traders in the streets of Durban. Since the lockdown was imposed on 26 March, informal traders were banned from selling their goods on the side of the street. However,  since the amendment of the regulations by Co-operative Governance and Traditional Affairs (Cogta) Minister, Nkosazana Dlamini Zuma on 6 April, allowing for registered spaza shops and informal food traders to trade, traders like Thanduxolo, are now back in business. Love them or hate them for cluttering the pavements of the normally bustling Durban CBD, informal traders have become a vital part of the economy. Standing next to his table, selling fruits and vegetables Thanduxolo, with his mask secured on his face, calls the prices out to passersby. “Bananas are R5 sisters and the veggies are R10,” he says. “We are back making a living, support informal traders. Our kids and families will never go hungry again, it’s been a rough few weeks.” Thanduxolo is among the few traders that are back in business as a number of designated areas and stalls remain empty in the Durban CBD. A few minutes away from Thanduxolo’s stall, the eThekwini Market, remains under lock and key. The area is known for having everything, from fruit and vegetables to traditional clothing and medicine. Outside the market, Sindi Zulu and her friends chop spinach and yams among other produce. They sell to commuters and taxi drivers waiting on public transport to resume at 4pm. Zulu said: “Business is pretty slow at the moment, but at least we are back to selling again and making money. We make what we can, not many people are out here but there is business.” The eThekwini Municipality said permits to operate during the lockdown are issued to licensed informal traders at the Sizakala Centres in Pinetown, Verulam, Tongaat, KwaMashu, 127 Johannes Nkosu Street and 16 Inwabi Road Isiphingo.
