In the early hours of every morning of every day, dedicated individuals wake up to tend to the land, keep the animals fed and battle against the elements.    During the past days, South Africans should have been reminded about the importance of where their food comes from. Many people forget that food does not come from supermarkets, spaza shops or street vendors. The food we need to survive comes from the farms and rural areas of our country. More importantly, that food is produced by farmers and farm workers who have intricate knowledge of the land and a dedication to a hard and often uncertain life and we owe it to them to remember the crucial role that they play – even outside of times of crisis.   Farmers are often the first to be victimised when socio-economic crises arise or when politicians need to cover up their own failures. Farm workers are also often the last to receive government houses, water, sanitation and electricity and often live in forgotten rural areas with few social amenities to improve their lives.    Once we have won the battle against Covid-19, the DA sincerely hopes that South Africans will not only remember its doctors and nurses, the police or the SANDF, but also our largely unseen farmers and farm workers who will continue their important work long after the virus has disappeared.   To quote Canadian international mentor, inspirational speaker and farmer, Brenda Schoepp, “My grandfather used to say that once in your life you need a doctor, a lawyer, a policeman, and a preacher. But every day, three times a day, you need a farmer.”     Chris Pappas, MPL DA KZN Spokesperson on Agriculture and Rural Development
