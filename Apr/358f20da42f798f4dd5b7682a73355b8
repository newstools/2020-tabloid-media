Dr Tedros Ghebreyesus, Director-General of the World Health Organisation (WHO) said that the United Nations Supply Chain Task Force was established to coordinate and scale up the procurement and distribution of PPE, lab diagnostics and oxygen to needy countries.  He mentioned that the system will consist of hubs in Belgium, China, Ethiopia, Ghana, Malaysia, Panama, the United Arab Emirates and South Africa. Dr Tedros Ghebreyesus was addressing the media on 10 April, where he discussed the impact of the coronavirus (Covid-19) pandemic on Africa.  He said: “In the past week, we’ve seen a welcome slowing in some of the hardest-hit countries in Europe, like Spain, Italy, Germany and France. At the same time, we’ve seen an alarming acceleration in other countries. I want to highlight Africa, where the virus is spreading to rural areas. We are now seeing clusters of cases and community spread in more than 16 countries. We anticipate severe hardship for already overstretched health systems, particularly in rural areas, which normally lack the resources of those in cities,” Dr Ghebreyesus explained that DR Moeti, the WHO Regional Director for Africa, had highlighted that there is a need to localize the response, by urgently strengthening the existing public health and primary health care infrastructure in countries.Dr Ghebreyesus said that the G20 countries expressed strong support for Africa, which must be expedited even though the numbers in Africa are still relatively small but accelerating. He further said: “I know that some countries are already planning the transition out of stay-at-home restrictions. WHO wants to see restrictions lifted, however, lifting restrictions too quickly could lead to a deadly resurgence. The way down can be as dangerous as the way up if not managed properly. WHO is working with affected countries on strategies for gradually and safely easing restrictions.” Dr Ghebreyesus said that important factors to consider are that: •   Transmission is controlled.  •   Sufficient public health and medical services are available.  •   Outbreak risks in special settings like long-term care facilities are minimized.  •   Preventive measures are in place in workplaces, schools and other places where it’s essential for people to go.  •   Importation risks can be managed.  •   Communities are fully aware and engaged in the transition. Dr Ghebreyesus said that everyone has a role to play in ending the pandemic. He expressed concern for the large numbers of infections reported among health workers, as in some countries there are reports of more than 10 percent of health workers being infected. “This is an alarming trend. When health workers are at risk, we’re all at risk. Evidence from China, Italy, Singapore, Spain and the United States is helping us to understand why this is happening, and what we can do about it. It shows that some health workers are actually being infected outside health facilities, in their homes or communities, “said Dr Ghebreyesus. He added that within health facilities, common problems are the late recognition of Covid-19, or lack of training or inexperience in dealing with respiratory pathogens. He said that many health workers are also being exposed to large numbers of patients in long shifts with inadequate rest periods, however, the evidence also shows that when health workers wear personal protective equipment the right way, infections can be prevented. “ That makes it even more important that health workers are able to access the masks, gloves, gowns and other PPE they need to do their jobs safely and effectively, “ said Dr Ghebreyesus.  He explained that to support countries, WHO has launched three tools to help managers and planners calculate the health workers, supplies and equipment that will be needed for the increase in Covid-19 patients:      •   The new United Nations Supply Chain Task Force, to coordinate and scale up the procurement and distribution of PPE, lab diagnostics and oxygen to needy countries.     •   The initiative will be coordinated by WHO and the World Food Programme.      •   Hubs in Belgium, China, Ethiopia, Ghana, Malaysia, Panama, South Africa and the United Arab Emirates.        Dr Ghebreyesus estimated the supply chain may need to cover more than 30 percent of the world’s needs in the acute phase of the pandemic. He said every month, there will be a need to ship at least 100 million medical masks and gloves; up to 25 million N95 respirators, gowns and face-shields; up to 2.5 million diagnostic tests and large quantities of oxygen concentrators and other equipment for clinical care. He added that to move supplies around the world, the World Food Programme will deploy eight 747 aircraft, eight medium-sized cargo aircraft, and several smaller passenger planes to move humanitarian workers, technical staff, trainers and other personnel. Dr Ghebreyesus said that the WFP estimates it will need approximately US$280 million, to cover the costs of storing and moving supplies whilst the costs of procuring supplies will be much greater. He urged donors to support the vitally important system and called on all donors to support the World Food Programme.
