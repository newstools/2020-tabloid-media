President Cyril Ramaphosa will not be lifting the regulation which places a total ban on the sale of alcohol during the Covid-19 National State of Disaster and Lockdown.  This after the Gauteng Liquor Forum had made representations,  requesting government to lift or amend the regulation on the total ban on the sale of alcohol.   According to the presidential spokesperson, Khusela Diko, who was briefing journalists on Friday, 17 April, after much consideration of the issues raised by the liquor forum, the president has decided that the ban on the sale of alcohol will not be lifted. “This is a view that is supported by a number of organisations, many of them which are operating in the liquor industry. These organisations, like government and many people in South Africa have understood that the regulations in place have been put there to contain the spread of the coronavirus and to minimise the loss of lives during this period. “They have also understood the proven links that exist between the sale and consumption of alcohol, violent crime, motor vehicle accidents and other pressures that affect the health system at a time where we need our system to be operating at an optimal capacity in order to assist those affected by Covid-19.” Diko said it was indeed regrettable and inevitable that the lockdown will cause severe financial hardships on many businesses and not just the liquor industry. “It is for this reason that government continues to call  on businesses that are in distress to approach the department of small business, the unemployment insurance fund and many other private sector business initiatives that have been set up to assist during this time,” said Diko. She further stated that the challenges that will be imposed on South African society by the lockdown and the coronavirus pandemic are not unique to the liquor industry but affect everyone.
