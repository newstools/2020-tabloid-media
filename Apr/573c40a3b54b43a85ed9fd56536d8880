While South Africa’s economy is buckling under the strain of the lockdown, and with many businesses unable to trade, the South African Reserve Bank has announced an emergency cut of the repo rate by another 100 basis points. This might be good news for many, but many independent businesses deemed “non-essential” will still stay closed with zero income under the National State of Disaster’s lockdown declaration. This latest repo rate cut brings the country’s rate to 4.25 percent. The bank cut the rate by one percentage point last month. At the same time, rating agency Moody’s last month downgraded South Africa’s credit rating to “junk status”. The world economy is no doubt buckling. Reserve Bank Governor Lesetja Kganyago said that the country’s economy was under pressure and growth forecasts in negative territory. “The bank expects GDP in 2020 to contract by 6.1 percent compared to -0.2 percent expected just a few weeks ago,” he said. Kganyago said that China appeared to be recovering and that this was “good news” for economies, including South Africa. However, for now, the rand is still under pressure. “The rand has depreciated by 22.6 percent against the US dollar since January and by 17.3 percent since the March meeting of the MPC,” he said. Kganyago said that inflation was under control for now but this could change and the bank has needed to act. One person running his business from home said that the cut in the repo rate does not mean anything if he cannot trade. “I run my small manufacturing business from home. Since the lockdown started I have not sold any of my products because I cannot go out. I am not deemed an essential service. How am I going to survive?” The businessman, who preferred not to be named, is based in Overport, and produces and packs biltong. He said that the government should have taken more time to consider small entrepreneurs and the loss of income.
