The Department of Education has taken the decision to postpone the May/ June Amended Senior Certificate (old matric) and National Senior Certificate Examination. The examinations which were scheduled to take place between May and June will be merged with the finals in November. In a statement released this morning, (Saturday, 18 April) Mathanzima Mweli, the Department of Basic Education (DBE) Director-General, said that he has already confirmed the postponement, in an official letter, with the heads of the provincial departments informing about the green lighting of the changes. Mweli said: “At the HEDCOM meeting of 10 April, it was agreed that the May to June examination should be merged with the November examination.” More than 350 000 part-time candidates, which include those that did not meet the pass requirements in the 2019 final exams as well as those who sought to rewrite to improve their marks, were due to write their National Senior Certificate examinations from 4 May to 26 June. Mweli said the details regarding the merged June and November examination will be communicated in due course and that candidates will be informed regarding registration, examination centers and time-tables. The exams were pushed back due to the disruption caused by the Covid-19 lockdown, which force the early closure of the first term in all schools throughout South Africa. The extension of the 21-days lockdown, from 26 March to 16 April, to 30 April means schools will not reopen in time for matric preparation. Department spokesperson, Elijah Mhlanga, said learning and revision materials have been made available on the DBE website, to assist with matric preparation and revision. “The Second Chance Matric Support Programme link on the website is still available to assist especially those who had been studying independently as part-time candidates,” Mhlanga said.
