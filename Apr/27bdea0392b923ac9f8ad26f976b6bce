According to recent media reports, South Africans may see Eskom power cuts returning, once the nation-wide lockdown is lifted in May, with power cuts “most likely” to continue until August 2021. This is according to Bheki Nxumalo, Eskoms head of power generation who spoke to a Sunday paper. Eskom issued a statement on the 27 March, at the commencement of the lockdown, stating that: “ no load shedding is expected during the lockdown as demand has dropped.” However, energy experts were quoted as saying that while the national lockdown had reduced the demand for electricity, it has only allowed Eskom to conduct low-level and routine repairs.  Eskom said it has not been able to conduct deep-cycle maintenance due to worldwide restrictions and lockdowns. They said that they were prevented from bringing in specialised engineers to work on the equipment. It is believed that the maintenance will only start once the lockdown is over and is expected to run until August 2021. Maintenance includes massive replacement of boiler and turbine components. 
 Economists are saying that businesses are already facing massive challenges following the coronavirus National State of Disaster Lockdown. The closure of non-essential services during the lockdown means that millions of jobs could be lost in South Africa this year. The looming load shedding will not be good for businesses.
