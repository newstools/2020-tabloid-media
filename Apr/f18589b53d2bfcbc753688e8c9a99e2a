The national lockdown has not deterred marauding criminals who pounced on a Bulwer residence thrice in two days. The aggrieved resident recently shared her misfortune on the Bulwer Safety and Urban Regeneration Forum Facebook and said the criminals entered her house on Monday, 6 April, at 10pm, using her neighbour’s side of the garden. According to the resident, she realised that she had been robbed when she went to her laundry room and found the room ransacked with items missing. “All the cupboards were emptied out and the step ladder was stolen,” she said.The Bulwer resident added that she was grateful that she did not walk in on the burglars while they were still in action. The appreciative resident thanked Blue Security and SAPS Flying Squad for quickly responding to their distress call.On Wednesday, 8 April, three suspects were arrested. Heather Roos, chairperson of the Umbilo Community Policing Forum, said that some community members shared posts about being robbed on more than one occasion.In media reports, Roos said, “The numbers of reports were of great concern and were linked to the number of vagrants suddenly moving around in communities. There’s a camp set up in Albert Park which is very close to our community, and residents have been complaining about the number of vagrants and homeless people in the area.” Roos said criminals saw the lockdown as an opportunity to execute their criminal activities. She said although the streets were quieter, there were a number of vagrants who were aggressive towards residents, asking for money or cigarettes, but not food. Roos has urged residents to be cautious and upgrade their security.
