World Health Organisation spokesperson, Dr Margaret Harris has said that South Africa is still in the early stages of the coronavirus (Covid-19) outbreak and has time to flatten the curve. Dr Harris was speaking to a local news channel via skype yesterday, Thursday 9 April. When asked if South Africa should extend the lockdown, Dr Harris said lockdown gives time and space and is a “functional strategy” for most societies.  She said ideally we should be targeting the virus to stop transmitting so that we can move back to a more normal society. She said that South Africa still has the time to put in the necessary measures to combat the coronavirus. Dr Harris said: “You are still early in the outbreak and have time to flatten the curve. You’ve got time to find the virus, and put in social distancing measures by limiting opportunities for crowding.“  Dr Harris further said that Africa has an advantage than most continents and countries because she feels that Africa is used to dealing with outbreaks, so they understand the importance of surveillance and quarantine. Globally, the number of coronavirus confirmed cases stand at 1570 349 with 92 191 deaths. The number of confirmed Covid19 cases in South Africa stands at 1934 and 18 reported deaths. Following a meeting with the National Command Council, President Cyril Ramaphosa addressed the nation last night, Thursday 09 April and announced that the lockdown would be extended to end of April. He urged the country to adhere to the regulations of the lockdown as it was the only way to flatten the curve and curb the spread of the virus leading to more deaths.
