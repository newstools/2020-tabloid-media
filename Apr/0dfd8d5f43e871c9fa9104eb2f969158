She said that according to the rollout testing schedule only hotspots and surrounding areas will be screened and testing will only be done for those who are symptomatic. “If your area is not listed it means yours is not considered a hotspot and the teams will not be coming to your area.

She said that approximately 40 houses in the central Umhlanga area, will be screened. “Please don’t stress as we are doing our best to ensure that this programme is rolled out successfully and where necessary.

Bollman said, the teams will be using a NDM (Ethekweni Metro Municipality) registration vehicle and will have either a council or provincial identiﬁcation. “We will continue to update you as we receive information.  We ask you to please try to comply so the process can move along without any complications,” she added.
