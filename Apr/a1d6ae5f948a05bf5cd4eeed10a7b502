Police Minister, Bheki Cele, has attributed the significant drop in contact crime such as rape and murder to the high visibility of law enforcement during the Covid-19 lockdown. Cele was speaking at a media briefing in Durban on Wednesday, 22 April, where he was doing an assessment on the adherence to the lockdown rules and regulations. Cele said: “Due to the lockdown, the heightened visibility, reinforced by the deployment of the SANDF and other variables such as the prohibition of the sale of liquor, we have seen a significant drop across most crime categories.” Preliminary statistics indicate that during the lockdown, from 27 March to 20 April, murder is down 72 percent, from 1 542 to 432, with an 82 percent decrease in the number of cases reported, from 2 908 to 371, when compared to the same period in 2019. Trio crimes such as carjacking, robbery and housebreaking are down 80.9 percent, 65.5 percent and 53.8 percent respectively. “We will at an appropriate time after the lockdown, give a comprehensive crime picture as we are yet to table the 2019/2020 crime statistics to Parliament. At this stage we welcome the decrease in especially contact crime and trio crimes as both crime categories are known to instill fear and terror among our citizens,” Cele said.
