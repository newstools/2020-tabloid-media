Mayor of Uthukela District Municipality,  Cllr Siphwe Mazibuko, joined the health department professionals team, yesterday, 13 April. The team led by Khehla Mazibuko and Cllr Makho Mbatha, of Ward 21 in Steadville, was deployed in Jabavu for the mass screening and testing programme. “The reception received by the team was good and very welcoming but we also observed in some areas that people were were still roaming around the streets and not adhering or observing lockdown regulations,” said Mayor Mazibuko. This, according to the Uthukela Mayor is still one of the biggest challenges for the country that seeks to flatten the curve of the pandemic. “As part of community education and awareness raising, parents are responsible for keeping their children at home during this difficult time. Adults are then responsible for their own actions”, he said. The program also included a site visit of Ezakheni B Section. In this area members of the community were affected by sewer blockages and spillages which were being attended to. One of the community members cited that she was delighted to be  visited by the Mayor and that it was pleasing to see their challenges being addressed. The mayor also inspected Ezakheni E Section (Kwa E omdala) to attend to complaints about low water pressure which causes people not to receive water as normal. A commitment was made by Uthukela to send a team from the water department to attend to the issue and he promised to come back to see the progress made.
