City officials, municipal workers, government staffers, NGOs, faith leaders, corporates, organisations and individuals have joined hands to work together as a team and they bore the fruit of their efforts with astonishing results. A dream team comprising of the City, the Denis Hurley Centre, We are Durban, NGOs and faith communities, have created safe interim spaces for 1,700 of  the city’s street people in response to the national lockdown protocols. Once the homeless were successfully housed, the challenge was to keep boredom at bay. The men and women from the entrepreneurial initiative Street Lit, a project of the Denis Hurley Centre supported by the Booksellers of Mzanzi, instantly put up their hands to help. Within hours of the callout, 15 boxes were packed, one per site, from the vendors’ personal supply of books.  Books were carefully selected to ensure suitability, which included a bundle of children’s books for the few children being housed with their mothers in shelters. The award-winning Street Lit project comprises of a dozen men and women from the city’s poor, unemployed and vulnerable communities, most of them formerly homeless themselves. They have been trained and set up as individual entrepreneurs to sell second-hand books, which have been donated to the organisation. The Street Lit project aims to put books back on the streets and in the hands of people who are eager to read but cannot necessarily afford new books. The vendors typically sell at public gatherings such as markets, festivals, events, creative spaces and retail outlets. The sale of books provides a frugal income for all participants which has been enormously eroded due to lockdown. All of the vendors are abiding by the lockdown regulations and are thus unable to earn currently.
