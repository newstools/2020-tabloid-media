Three weeks after the country entered into an unprecedented nation-wide lockdown to contain the spread of the coronavirus, the Minister of Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs (COGTA), Dr Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma, has announced the amended regulations. As the next phase of the lockdown begins today on Friday, 17 April, under strict conditions, electricians, plumbers and other qualified trade persons will now be able to buy the goods needed for emergency repairs as stores selling hardware products and vehicle components will be allowed to open. The revised regulations further state that only qualified persons may buy supplies needed for emergency repairs at residential homes and vehicle components can be bought only for repairs to vehicles used in essential services. Stores will have to keep a register of the people buying essential goods and buyers will need to sign a form each time they visit the store to attest that the goods bought are essential goods. Essential service providers can also buy any hardware and other supplies needed to provide their services.
