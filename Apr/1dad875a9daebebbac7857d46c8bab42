A Chatsworth family has been quarantined and those they were in contact with are being tested after a family member allegedly tested positive for Covid-19. He had visited RK Khan Hospital, a few days back for testing and the results have come back positive, today, 5 April. It is alleged that the Moorton man was suffering with serious post nasal and breathing problems. He was quarantined at RK Khan Hospital until tests were conducted. After results proved that he was positive, he was transferred to Grey’s Hospital in Pietermaritzburg. It is further alleged that he had visited a few friends during the period of being sick as he had assumed it was just the flu. The house has been cordoned off by members of Chatsworth SAPS, a short while ago. Regarding the incident, Councillor Previn Vedan of Ward 71 said, “I am aware of the reports of the Covid-19 case that is presently circulating. While we await official communications from the Department of Health, I wish to advise that I have been in contact with the affected family and the immediate community. The necessary protocols are being followed and I have made interventions with the relevant authorities.” He encouraged residents not to panic. “I have the utmost confidence in our medical workers, hospitals and the systems that have been put into place. We must all continue to follow the directives of our nationwide lockdown,” Vedan said.
