The MEC for Education in KwaZulu-Natal, Mr Kwazi Mshengu has warned against robbing the youth of their future after three laptops, a microwave and 50 e-readers were stolen from a primary school in KwaMashu on Sunday, 12 April. The state-of-the-art Ethekwini Primary School was officially opened by the MEC on 13 February this year. “Education is paramount to the future of our young people and that of the country and if you steal ICT infrastructure that is meant to enhance access to education, then you are no different to someone who is stealing the future of the youth. We will push for harsh action to be taken against those who vandalize and steal learning support infrastructure in school,” said MEC Mshengu. He said the matter has been reported to the police who are already searching for the suspects. The Department of Education has also received reports of similar cases from three other schools under Pinetown and is busy verifying those cases. “The Department of Education in KwaZulu-Natal reiterates its call for members of the community to report any suspicious activities around schools to the police, ” added Mshengu. The Minister of Basic Education Angie Motshekga announced that 183 schools have been affected since the Covid-19 lockdown began. She condemned the vandalism, burglary and destruction of schools across several provinces.“It is quite disheartening that criminal elements in our communities could destroy the infrastructure of their own children with such apparent impunity. I am in constant touch with the minister of police and with assistance of the state intelligence forces, we are following leads for the immediate arrest and prosecution of every single criminal responsible,” said Motshekga.
