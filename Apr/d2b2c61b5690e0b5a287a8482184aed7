A case of arson is being investigated by Chatsworth SAPS after a fire broke out at a shopping centre situated in Westcliff, Unit 3 Chatsworth on Monday night. The owner of the shop where the fire started, Suren Moodley of Pershans Prayer Goods told The Chatsworth Tabloid that he was in Gauteng when he found out about the fire. He said that he has suffered damages of close to R800 000. He is in the process of clearing all the damages and starting afresh. Another shop owner, Sakun Babooram of Globe Electrical said that she had suffered damages of almost R100 000. “I have no insurance and the fire has affected my business really badly. Previously when I owned a bigger shop a few doors away I had insurance but now because of my shop being so small I didn’t consider it.  I am currently clearing all the damaged items so I can move forward”. she said Rajen Naidu, owner of Pershans Florist said that break-ins are becoming an issue in Westcliff and surrounding areas in Chatsworth. “The damages to my business and the theft came to about R12000. I believe it was theft and an arson attack and I have an idea of who may be responsible. The police are working on the information that was given to them and I am sure that the suspects will be brought to book, ” he warned. Naidu believes if the community works together and becomes more vigilant and aware, and report suspicious behaviour, it can curb such incidents. ” We need to become the eyes and ears for our neighbourhood, ” said Naidu. KZN police spokesperson said, “No injuries were reported. The matter is still under investigation.”
