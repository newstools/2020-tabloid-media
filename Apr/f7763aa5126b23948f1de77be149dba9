Hundreds of patient’s queued outside the RK Khan Hospital earlier today, to collect their medication as well as for doctor’s appointments. Patients queued from the hospital right up to Montdene Drive (Road 502), which is about one kilometer away. According to Councillor Tony Govender, over the past few weeks they have noticed that there is a lengthy queue outside the hospital. “The people are being screened at the entrance and we noticed that most of the people who were in the queue were collecting medication.” After speaking to the pharmacy manager, Brian Pillay, it was noted that it was not the fault of the hospital. He explained that the distribution points that were being used previously were closed as the volunteers who are elderly were afraid to risk their lives during the Covid19 pandemic. He said that to alleviate the situation, if people still have medication, they should continue using that and not follow the queue to fetch their medication. Patients should not believe the rumors spreading that if they do not collect medication, they won’t receive a grant. Residents believe that there should be more input from the hospital and the government. Security companies and councilors should assist patients with social distancing as this is only done inside the hospital but assistance is needed on the outside as well.
