EThekwini Municipality’s deputy head of communications, Mandla Nsele said, “The separation at source initiative, orange bags has been suspended until further notice to reduce the risk of contamination. Residents are encouraged to limit the amount of recyclables generated, or to reuse, upcycle or store recyclables within your properties, or as a last resort dispose into black bag for collection.” All garden drop off sites and garden landfills has been closed from Tuesday, 31 March until further notice. Residents are encouraged during this time to reduce the generation of this waste stream by limiting cutting, pruning etc. Reuse through home scale composting and store on the property until services resume. Nsele further added, “The Bisasar Road, Mariannhill and Shallcross Landfills which accepts garden refuse, builder’s rubble and sand has been closed from Tuesday, 31 March until further notice. Residents are reminded to have all personal hygiene and sanitary products double bagged without compressing the waste. This is encouraged to be handled using single use gloves and or ensure hands are sanitised before and after handling.” He advised that residents prevent waste bags from being left in areas that are easily accessible to animals as well as street pickers for salvaging purposes. Waste bags are only to be placed out for collection if they are full.
