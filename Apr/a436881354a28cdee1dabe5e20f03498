The Department of Basic Education (DBE) has warned the public not to be misled by the recent reports stating that the Grade 7’s and matriculants may be returning to school on 6 May. Speaking to Tabloid Newspapers, on Friday 17 April, the DBE’s spokesperson Elijah Mhlanga said that he can confirm that there were such proposals which were part of the departments draft post Covid-19 lockdown discussions with teacher unions and governing body associations, however, this has changed. “The media has a choice on what to report on. By reporting on something that has not been confirmed they are at a risk of being discredited when it doesn’t happen. Since the reported discussions, the proposal in the previous discussion has been overtaken by other events. Nothing has been confirmed as yet,” said Mhlanga. Media reports said that the report which was seen by one media house stated that the tentative dates for pupils to return to school were scheduled for grades to return at different times i.e Matric and Grade 7 being the first pair of grades scheduled for 6 May, Grades 11 and 6 on 20 May, Grades 10 and 5 on 3 June, Grades 9 and 4 on 17 June. Grades 3 and 8 on 1 July, Grades 2 and 1 on 8 July and Grade R on 15 July. The report said that the dates were proposed depending on whether the lockdown is lifted on 30 April. The department has said all discussions will only be finalised after the Department of Health declares that it is safe for pupils to return to school.
