Government has stipulated that South Africans stay at home and practice social distancing during the nationwide lockdown. This is to flatten the curve and curb the spread of the coronavirus (Covid-19) disease. With the number of coronavirus cases increasing daily, members of the public are urged to continue to practice social distancing to protect themselves and their families against Covid-19.   Social distancing means keeping a safe distance between yourself and other people. •   Families must put distance between themselves and others in their community to help prevent the spread of Covid-19. 
•   Through social distancing, we can slow the spread of Covid-19, especially to those who are at a higher risk of illness.
•   The best and most effective way to practice social distancing is to stay at home and do not receive visitors. 
•   Do not go to social spaces and avoid large groups of people that are in one place.
•   When going out to purchase food and essential items, ensure a space of 1.5 meters between you and the next person. Enforce social distancing for your children. •   Children should not have play-dates or get-togethers with children from other households during the lockdown to limit the spread of the virus.
•   If children are playing outside their own home, it is essential that they remain away from anyone who is not in their own household.
•   Do not allow children to interact with others as this can potentially continue the chain of viral spread into the community. 
•   While children may be asymptomatic carriers, they can transmit Covid-19 to members of their family or anyone else they have had contact with. This can put parents and others at home at risk, especially those with pre-existing medical conditions. Play your part by following the social distancing rules. •   As part of social distancing, citizens are not allowed to jog or walk their dogs during the lockdown period. •   These regulations also apply to people living within estates and complexes. •   All estate and complex managers are encouraged to assist in ensuring that these regulations are enforced. The fundamental purpose of a lockdown is to drastically reduce the movement of people in order to prevent the spread of the COVID-19 virus. You can still be social just in different ways. Take advantage of social media and video apps to connect with friends and family until the virus is under control.
