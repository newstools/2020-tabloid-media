Transport Minister Fikile Mbalula has called on the taxi industry to reduce the number of passengers being transported during the 21-day nationwide lockdown. The minister said that during the lockdown period, public transport vehicles must reduce the number of maximum passengers to 70% of the licensed capacity, with no masks as follows:
• A minibus licensed to carry 10 passengers is limited to carry a maximum of 7 passengers.
• A minibus licensed to carry 15 passengers is limited to carry a maximum of 10 passengers.
• A midi-bus permitted to carry a maximum of 22 passengers, is limited to carry a maximum of 15 passengers
• A vehicle licensed to carry a maximum of four passengers is limited to carrying 50% of its permissible passenger carrying capacity. Alternatively, all minibus and midi-bus taxi vehicles are permitted to load their maximum 100% passenger loading capacity as provided for in their operating licenses, provided that all passengers are wearing masks. 
The masks must be either surgical masks or N95 respiratory masks. Mbalula further reiterated the call for public transport operators to sanitise their vehicles. Under the regulations announced by the Minister following the declaration of Covid-19 as a National State of Disaster, public modes of transport were allowed to operate from 5am – 9am and again from 4pm – 8pm. However, these times have now been revised to 5am – 10am and again from 4pm to 8pm. Mbalula said the revised regulations will contribute to the preservation of life. “We must all appreciate that the measures we have introduced to curb the spread of this virus are about preserving human life and not about our individual narrow self-serving interest. Everyone must appreciate this and play their part,” he said.
