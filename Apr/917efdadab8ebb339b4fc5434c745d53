More than 50 undocumented foreign nationals were nabbed by law enforcement officers together with inspectors from the Department of Economic Development, Tourism and Environmental Affairs (EDTEA) in a raid conducted in the Durban CBD on Wednesday, 22 April. EDTEA MEC, Nomusa Dube-Ncube thanked the officers and inspectors for their joint efforts. The team managed to seize counterfeit goods in the foreigner’s possession with more than R100 000 cash discovered. Dube-Ncube said; “These fraudsters are crippling our economy and have put the lives of innocent communities at risk who are buying and consuming such fake goods. We need to protect our economy and ensure that it benefits local communities. Their health is also important.”
