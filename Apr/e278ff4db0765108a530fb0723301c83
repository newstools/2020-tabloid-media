Smokers across South Africa are furious with the government after the Minister of Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs (Cogta), Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma, announced last night (Wednesday 29 April) that the cigarette ban will remain in place during Level 4 Lockdown restrictions that is scheduled to take effect on 1 May. According to Dlamini-Zuma, the National Command Council took into account feedback from the public and decided not to allow the sale of cigarettes and other tobacco products in the new Level 4 Lockdown Regulations. Smokers feel government has reneged on the cigarette ban upliftment in light of President Cyril Ramaphosa’s announcement on 23 April, when he said cigarette sales will be allowed. Dlamini-Zuma cited health reasons for the continued ban and added that smoking posed more risk in the spread of the Coronavirus. She said that cigarettes are often shared amongst smokers (especially those who cannot afford it) and poses a health risk by promoting the spread of Covid-19 while forsaking the social distancing rule. Dlamini-Zuma said the decision was taken as a responsive government who considered the input from the public, following 2 000 public comments against unbanning cigarette sales. Meanwhile, the Fair Trade Independent Tobacco Association (Fita) is setting in motion plans to go the legal route with action to be taken against the government in challenging the cigarette ban. Fita said: “Consulting with our attorneys and senior counsel on the urgent court application first thing in the morning. Let a court of law adjudicate on this issue once and for all.” Smokers have since united in their bid to see the ban lifted and more than 270,000 South Africans have reportedly signed a petition calling for the government to unban the sale of cigarettes.
