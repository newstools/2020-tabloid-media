A 30-year-old suspect was arrested in Wentworth and will join four other accused in the murder investigation of a 32-year-old man who was shot dead in Sydenham, in November last year. A multi-disciplinary operation was conducted by the detectives from the Provincial Organised Crime Unit together with other units including the Provincial Drug and Firearm Unit as well as the Provincial Trio Crimes Task Team to solve the Sydenham murder case. Police spokesperson Captain Nqobile Gwala, said: “During the operation, a 30-year-old suspect was arrested at a block of flats on Hime Street in Wentworth. The arrest arises from an incident that occurred in Sydenham on 25 November 2019.  “Adam Venter, 32, was found dead with two gunshot wounds to the face on Barns Road in Sydenham. A case of murder was opened at the Sydenham police station and the docket was assigned to the Provincial Organised Crime Unit for investigation.” She added: “The suspect will appear in the Durban Magistrates Court on 9 April. He will be joining his four co-accused that were arrested last week. One of the accused was found in possession of a pistol with four rounds of ammunition. The accused are in custody and they will reappear in court on 16 April. The firearm is suspected to be linked to Venter’s death and two of the accused are suspected to be linked to other murder cases in Sydenham.” KwaZulu-Natal Provincial Commissioner, Lieutenant General Khombinkosi Jula expressed his gratitude to the team for the arrests. “We remain committed to fighting the scourge of drug abuse in the province and drug-related feuds will not deter us from our crime-fighting mandate,” he said.
