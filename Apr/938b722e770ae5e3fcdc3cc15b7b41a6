We are now two weeks into the 21 day lockdown, and some residents abided to the presidents instruction to avoid bulk buying. Tabloid Newspapers chatted to a few people to find out how their grocery cupboards are looking and whether the food they have will last them till the lockdown ends. Kim Griffith Jones:  I did not bulk buy.  I normally go to the shops every day because I don’t like anything to go to waste. I don’t want food to spoil. Since lockdown we haven’t been eating much, but maybe we will be going to the shops to stock up on fresh vegetables and fruits. That is mainly what my girls and I have been eating. We are just doing what we normally do, trying not to waste and being mindful of our refuse waste as well. Jenny Arjuna : We did not buy in bulk. We just bought more cans. It’s difficult because we are afraid of going to the shops and we don’t want to over buy since we still not sure how long lockdown will last. Maya Jagjivan: We did not bulk buy, we just bought our normal monthly grocery. My husband does pop in to the shops now and then just to get fresh bread, fruits and vegetables. Steven Jones: We stocked up on supplies so we won’t have to go to the shops often. We bought enough beans, lentils, rice, pasta and oil. We are going to survive at least up to 10 days or so and will be going to the shop again soon. We have also made use of some fresh produce delivery service.
