Parents and pupils are invited to take advantage of free WorksheetCloud lessons which launched today, Thursday, 2 April. All lessons are free for your children doing Grade 3 to Grade 7 to join and are facilitated by highly-qualified and experienced South African teachers.  Children will get access to quality teaching during the national lockdown. All the child needs is an internet enabled device; a cellphone, tablet or a computer, which can access YouTube. No registration is required. The lessons are taught in English, in line with the South African CAPS curriculum and are also suitable for IEB. Joining a class is easy and the data cost is equal to watching a YouTube video. 
What’s more exciting about the programme is that if a child misses a lesson, they can catch up, as each lesson is recorded and is available five hours after the live lesson.  If and when the pupil has a question on the lesson an email address has been made available for questions. All lessons are strictly controlled and monitored. Your child will remain completely anonymous during lessons and there is no way that anyone can contact your child during or after lessons. There are no private lessons. For more information and to be part of the online class, click on the following link https://www.worksheetcloud.com/live/
