Coming into the Dolphins set-up from outside the province are two VKB Knights stars, Keegan Petersen and Ottneil Baartman, while Northerns’ Ruan de Swardt, also joins the KZN set-up. “Keegan has been a very consistent run scorer across all competitionsand to have a player of his calibre coming in to strengthen the top order is a massive boost and adds to the depth we have in our squad.” said franchise CEO, Heinrich Strydom “Petersen was rewarded with a call-up to the Standard Bank Proteas squad for their recent test series with England and this is a good indicator that his career is heading on the right trajectory.“Baartman has made the step up from semi-professional cricket to franchise level well and stood out for the Knights in their recent Momentum One Day Cup campaign as he finished as the side’s third highest wicket taker in the competition.“Ottneil has shown over the last season that he has what it takes at franchise level and we wanted to give him a chance to play regular cricket at that level. He bowled well for the Knights in the recent One Day Cup and will add good balance to our bowling line-up”, said Strydom “22 year-old De Swardt has hugely impressive numbers at semi-professional level especially with a batting average of 55 in First Class cricket and 88 in List-A cricket. “Ruan is a hugely talented young all-rounder and to be able to have him amongst our team is a massive bonus”, added Strydom The KZN Cricket Union’s highly successful development program continues to produce future stars, and will this year see Lifa Ntanzi and Andile Mogakane graduate to the Dolphins team.
