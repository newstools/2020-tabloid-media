The KwaZulu-Natal Department of Health is bracing itself for a worst case scenario by calling on unemployed medical professionals and students to sign up with their database.  In preparation and anticipation of more positive cases of Covid-19 following the mass screening and testing drive in Umlazi and in other parts of eThekwini over the weekend, the department is looking for suitable volunteers. The department said that the pandemic along with the pre-existing burden of disease in the province, the health sector might soon be under “tremendous pressure.” “That is why we are seeking assistance to fight the coronavirus from nursing students, second year upwards, student doctors from the fifth year upwards, unemployed health professionals, retired health practitioners and emergency medical service personnel who are not employees of the department,” Noluthando Nkosi, the department’s spokesperson said. As at today (Tuesday, 7 April), South Africa currently has 1749 confirmed cases of Covid-19 and 13 deaths. KZN accounts for eight of the deaths, with Western Cape three, Free State one and Gauteng one. Some of those affected by the coronavirus are healthcare professionals, the latest being doctors and nurses from St Augustine’s Hospital. Nkosi said those taken on by the department, will do so on a voluntary basis. She said: “We firmly believe that they can help mitigate the pressure that Covid-19 will be placing on health services, over the coming weeks and months. We appeal to these healthcare professionals to urgently get in touch with the department so that they can be registered on our department’s database.” This is also in line with stringent measures announced by President Cyril Ramaphosa recently, when he confirmed that tracers and testers will be sent to homes across South Africa in a bid to combat the spread of the deadly virus.
