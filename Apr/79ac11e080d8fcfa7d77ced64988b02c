The snap survey conducted by the Mozambik Restaurant Group to better understand the South African state of being during lockdown, has revealed that most citizens questioned, feel that social sistancing should become the new norm in a post-Covid world. 22% of respondents voted against the notion while 23% remain undecided. Indications are that at  54% a majority sentiment is clear. The snap survey was done between 9 and 10 April and responses collected via wide targeting, digitally, with just under 600 responses received in a 36-hour period. “Digital and social media allowed us to interrogate various strata in the population,” says Mozambik CEO Manny Nichas, “we wanted to get a feeling of sentiment out there after 2 weeks of lockdown and the announcement of a further period until end-April,” He added that nobody really knows what “next” is, and the snap survey forms part of the group’s larger interrogation of facts, figures and forecasts for a post-lockdown and Covid-19 trading environment. “While it’s a relatively small sample, I believe it represents sentiment amid a total lack of any other kind of data.” “I can certainly identify with the results of the snap survey,” says Nichas, who believes that it reasonably represents sentiment right now. “We are all uncertain, crave a measure of social interaction, albeit likely different to before in terms of levels of engagement, while experiencing quite a lot of stress about the economy and security of income. We need one another more than ever, and as communities we must stand together and support each other.”
