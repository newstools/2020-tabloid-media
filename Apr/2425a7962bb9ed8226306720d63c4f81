This week, the Health Minsiter, Dr Zweli Mkhize spotlighted the growing concern for the escalating Covid-19 related issues at Netcare St Augustine’s Hospital in Durban. “We are concerned about developments at Netcare St Augustine’s Hospital. 66 patients tested positive over the past few days. About 48 of them are staff,” said Dr Mkhize. Dr Mkhize added that the Provincial Department is engaging the hospital, with a view to closing parts of the hospital down. He said: “We hope the fumigation process will start soon there. We have also assigned specialists there. We must always be on the lookout. The infection can seep in from any institution. We must now trace all the contacts. It is a matter of serious concern and we are dealing with it.” As the second week of the national lockdown continues in the wake of the coronavirus outbreak in South Africa, Dr Mkhize revealed yesterday (Tuesday, 7 April) that the total number of confirmed Covid-19 cases in SA is 1749 with 13 fatalties.  Dr Mkhize said the 13th deceased was a male who had stage 4 prostate cancer at Parklands Hospital. “We convey our condolences to the family of the deceased,” he added. Dr Mkhize said that the numbers of patients, who are being treated, are slowly recovering and that mass testing has started in all provinces. On Friday, Netcare St Augustine’s Hospital closed the health facility’s emergency unit. Netcare Group CEO, Dr Richard Friedland, further said in a statement that they were no longer taking on new admissions. The testing of staff and patients at the facility were confirmed by Friedland. Meanwhile, Netcare has also appealed to residents who visited the hospital from 1 March onwards, to contact the Department of Health in the safety of their health. Anyone displaying symptoms of the coronavirus or has been exposed to the Covid-19 virus, is urged to contact the 24-hour hotline on 0800 029 999.
