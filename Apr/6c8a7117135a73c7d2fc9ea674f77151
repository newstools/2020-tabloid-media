The South African Association of Marine Biological Research (SAAMBR) team is mourning the death of their beloved 48 year old bottle nose dolphin Gambit, who passed away yesterday afternoon (Monday, 20 April). Gambit was a true South African icon and a legend in his own right who has helped to inspire millions of people to care for the ocean and has had a direct influence on the lives of thousands of people who have met him. According to SAAMBR, Gambit was father to five and grandfather to one of the SAAMBR dolphins.  They said he was also a consummate showman, always keen to take part in anything going on in the dolphinarium. He was one of the oldest dolphins to ever be documented. SAAMBR said Gambit was beginning to slow down and show signs of his age and was being carefully monitored by their animal care and veterinary teams. “His passing was unexpected but thankfully swift, leaving an enormous hole in the hearts of the SAAMBR team, many of whom have worked with Gambit for over 20 years,” said Gabby Harris, assistant curator of SAAMBR’s Mammal and Bird Department. Dr Larry Oellermann, CEO of SAAMBR expressed his deep sadness and support for the team. “I have known Gambit since 1977, when I first met him as a teenager visiting the old Durban Aquarium. The awe he inspired in me then was one of the reasons I became a marine biologist”, he said. “My thoughts go out to the team who has worked closely with Gambit over the years. All of us at SAAMBR share their loss.” “Our challenge is to translate this outpouring of compassion into meaningful action for our oceans, as we continue to work towards conserving our oceans not only for dolphins, but all marine life,” said SAAMBR’s Conservation Strategist, Dr Judy Mann.
