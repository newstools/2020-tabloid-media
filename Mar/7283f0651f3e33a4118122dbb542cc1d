In line with governments declaration of a National State of Disaster and public health advice, Park Run South Africa has taken the decision to close all parkrun events across South Africa, Namibia, and Eswatini with immediate effect, until further notice. The suspension is due to the current Covid-19 (coronavirus) disease and its impact. “Initially, this closure will be in place until the end of March, however this is to bring all parkrun countries into the same time frame and we very much expect closures to continue through April at least,” said South African Park Run CEO, Bruce Fordyce. Fordyce said that Ladysmith Country Club is the annual Saturday morning parkrun get together for many Ladysmith runners and walkers. They will receive updates from Park Run. “We know that this message may be a difficult one for you to receive, and many people will be wondering what to do without their regular weekly catch-up. You are assured that we are working hard to develop our strategy so that we are able to support the health and happiness of park runners around the world during this difficult time. Fordyce said that remaining active is incredibly important and Park Run is working on ways to encourage and support that. He also advised park runners not to arrange group gatherings at parkrun venues whilst parkrun events are suspended.
