Uthukela District Municipality has dispatched a team of laboratory technicians from Pietermaritzburg, after serious threats were made that the water supply at the Ezakheni Water treatment works had allegedly been poisoned by protestors. Jabulani Mkhonza, communications manager of Uthukela District said that they have contacted the Umgeni Water management to confirm if these threats are true or false. It is alleged that protestors made their way into the water treatment plant, late last night, 8 March. “Umgeni Water denied any knowledge of such a thing, To play it safe, they have also dispatched a team of laboratory technicians, to take water samples from the two reservoirs at the plant for testing. These tests will determine whether indeed water was contaminated or not,” said Mkhonza. The results are expected to be available by this afternoon. The public will be informed accordingly. ” We wish to make a call to all our people not to start panicking as this unfortunate situation is getting the attention it deserves, ” said Mkhonza.
