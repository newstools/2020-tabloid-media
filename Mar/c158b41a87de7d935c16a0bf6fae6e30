The Clare Estate Umgeni Hindu Crematorium Society (CEUHCS) will be open for cremations during the lockdown period. They will however be operating with limited staff. The CEUHCS has implemented new regulations to minimise the risk for those visiting the facility as well as their staff during the lockdown period, starting with the prohibition of hall hire. In compliance with the eThekwini Municipality’s directive, only 20 people, including family, will be allowed to attend funerals at the facility and only 5 people will be permitted to enter the final rites room.
Upon arrival at the crematorium, undertakers are required to provide management with a record of the correct names, addresses and contact numbers of those attending, including their staff members.
Funerals will now have a time slot of 30 minutes allocated, including the final rites before the cremation takes place. Family members will not be allowed to remain on the crematorium property during the cremation (approximately two hours) and will have to return to collect the ashes.
Hand sanitisers will be provided at the entrance and in the toilets. The venue will also be cleaned and sanitised after each funeral. The crematorium staff have been briefed on the seriousness of COVID-19 and have also been issued with personal protective equipment, which has been a part of the crematorium’s standard operating procedure. As a precautionary measure to ensure social distancing, a limited number of individuals will be allowed into the offices at a time. “We have familiarised ourselves with the measures recommended by the Department of Health and the Centre for Communicable Diseases, in the event that a deceased was a victim of COVID-19. We have also informed all funeral services and undertakers using our facilities of these recommended measures,” said the CEUHCS in a media statement.
