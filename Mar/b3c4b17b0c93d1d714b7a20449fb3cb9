Brahma Kumaris – World Spiritual University will be hosting online programmes for people to utilise in their own homes during the coronavirus pandemic faced by countries world-wide. Brahma Kumari’s Sister Dipty said: “Our centres, as required, are closed physically, however, we are available and aim to offer meditations and talks on a digital space so that we continue to inspire and support each other. At Brahma Kumaris – World Spiritual University, we are one world family and are deeply interconnected. Realising this, we are reminded that kindness and care towards one another is of paramount importance. Differences are irrelevant now and it’s our common humanity and connectedness that gives this life its value.” The regional director of the Brahma Kumaris, Sr Mohini said: “It is time to embody and serve with the qualities of compassion. First of all is self-compassion, which is to maintain a healthy mind, body and relationships. Not caring for the self is an act of disservice towards the self. Secondly, compassion for our world family; to help in whichever way we can, physically and emotionally but also to maintain such pure and loving thoughts so that the vibration of our collective loving energy can counteract the growing atmosphere of fear,” she said. “Always remember we are more powerful than any challenge we have faced. It’s time to turn inwards and connect to the Source so that we allow ourselves to experience that pure energy of love. When we are filled with the energy of Divine love we become conduits of that energy for the world. It’s time that we step away from thinking of ourselves in small ways and step into the awareness of being a child of the Divine, one who inherits all powers, virtues and spiritual treasures. With this we serve all of creation,” said Mohini. For more information on online programmes, visit: www.learnmeditationonline.org.
