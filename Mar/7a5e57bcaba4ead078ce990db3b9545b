The sterling work of Warrant Officer WN Marais of the Wentworth police station resulted in a burglar being jailed for 10 years by the Durban Regional Court. In 2018, the victim had left his home to drop off a friend. When he returned about 10 minutes later, he noticed that the accused had
stolen items from his house. The communications officer at the Wentworth police station, Captain Mbuso Gumede said, “The victim had to step out of the way after the suspect tried to stab him with a knife. The suspect fled the scene on foot with the bag of items stolen from the house. The victim chased after the suspect and caught him. The suspect however dropped the bag and ran away. The complainant proceeded to the police station and opened a criminal case. The case was assigned to Marais to investigate.” Gumede added that the suspect was traced and arrested by Marais with assistance of crime intelligence. The 27-year-old accused appeared in court and after some adjournments was jailed for 10 years. The station commander, Colonel Van Zyl and the branch commander, Lieutenant Colonel Duke commended Marais for his work and for ensuring that the criminal is behind bars,” said Gumede.
