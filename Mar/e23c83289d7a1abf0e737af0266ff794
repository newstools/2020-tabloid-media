8 people between the ages of 19 and 50 appeared in the Ladysmith Magistrate court, this morning (Monday, 30 March). The charges were defying the regulations of the national lockdown, which was instituted by President Cyril Ramaphosa on 23 March. The Ladysmith Magistrate court divided the 48 into three groups of 16 and they appeared in the dock individually.  When the first 16 appeared in “A” court, two of them pleaded guilty to the charges, and were given a R1000 fine or two months in imprisonment. The first to plead guilty was a 19-year-old pupil, in Grade 11, who told the court that she had been on her way to a friend’s house, to braid her hair. “You are at an age that knows the difference from right and wrong, and leaving your home under these strict conditions is uncalled for, as the coronavirus has been declared a global pandemic, so I sentence you to two months imprisonment or R1000 fine,” said Magistrate Moola. Other suspects appearing in court, all received R1200 bail and their cases have been remanded. One of the accused told the court that he has a permit to drive around town and was on his way to draw money, when police pulled him over. He told the magistrate that he will show his permit at his next appearance. The Ladysmith Magistrate court was running on “skeleton staff”, but ensured that the 48 appeared in court. Face masks and gloves were worn by the legal officials as they prepared for the afternoon. Police have told Ladysmith Herald that they are not allowing anyone to walk around and those found breaking the national lockdown, will face the long arm of the law. It was also reported that more charges are still being made by the Ladysmith Police. Updates will follow as cases are dealt with in the court.
