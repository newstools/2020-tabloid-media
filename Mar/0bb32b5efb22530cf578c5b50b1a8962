The organisers said the stance taken is in line with President Cyril Ramaphosa’s recent National State of Disaster announcement in the wake of the fast growing rate of coronavirus cases in SA.The president said to minimise the spread of the disease, all gatherings of more than 100 people have been cancelled with immediate effect. Vicky Wentzel, owner of Wozani Africa Events and co-founder of Africa Bike Week and the South Coast Bike Fest, stated: “It is unfortunate that this highly-anticipated event has to be cancelled, but, in light of the global pandemic, it is undoubtedly the right decision. The priority of all our events is the health and safety of the attendees and participants.”  She said full refunds will be made to any ticket holders of the South Coast Bike Fest. Refunds will also be made for any accommodation booked through Howler. To receive your refund, contact hello@bikefestsa.co.za. Wenzel said the Bike Fest in Ballito on the KZN North Coast in September is on track. Visit www.bikefestsa.co.za or ‘Bike Fest SA’ Facebook and Instagram pages for all the latest updates. Also Read:
