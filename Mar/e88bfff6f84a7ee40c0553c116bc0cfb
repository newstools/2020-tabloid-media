The South African Muslim Travel Association (Samta) has issued a statement today (Thursday, 5 March) that the temporary restriction and suspension imposed by the Saudi authorities on Umrah passengers has been extended until 31 March. This comes after a an initial suspension was in place until 5 March, when the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia placed a temporary ban on Umrah pilgrims in an attempt to ensure public safety by preventing the spread of the COVID-19 coronavirus. Secretary General of Samta, Ismail Olla said: ” The members of Samta have taken a unanimous decision to cancel all flights and hotel reservations for passengers booked until 31 March. The situation will be revised should the restrictions be lifted sooner. He advised that accredited travel agents be contacted for further details. Olla said, “The suspension also affects the holders of tourist visas originating from countries affected by the coronavirus. The temporary preventative measure has been taken by competent authorities in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia due to preparation of medical isolation centres at all Saudi borders.” Samta has begun engaging with various role players including airlines, hotels and operators with regards to the status of refunds for those pilgrims that are currently affected due to cancellation. ” We endeavor to do all possible in securing maximum refunds for our pilgrims, ” said Olla. He said that Samta will keep the public informed and updated with the latest developments.
