With the coronavirus (COVID-19) threatening to impact the very fabric of communities, religious organisations stand at the forefront to address concerns and find ways to limit spreading of the virus.    One of the many such organisations is the United Ulama Council of South Africa (UUCSA) that issued a statement in response to the global pandemic. This comes in the wake of President Cyril Ramaphosa declaring a national state of disaster on 15 March because of the coronavirus. Maulana Yusuf Patel, UUCSA secretary-general released a statement saying: “We normally stand  in awe of giant threats like earthquakes, floods, tsunamis, and  volcanic eruptions. The coronavirus spreads from something so small, so miniscule like respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes. These droplets can land in the mouths or noses of people who are nearby or possibly be inhaled into the lungs.” The UUCSA statement said, among other things: It is within the context of the five fundamentals that the following regarding the Masjid is suggested: a. Introduce hygiene protocolsAlthough we do not precisely know how long the virus can linger on surfaces a recent analysis suggests that the virus can remain viable in the air for up to three hours, on copper for up to four hours, on cardboard up to 24 hours and on plastic and stainless steel up to two to three days. Even though the US Centre for Disease Control and Prevention says: “Transmission of coronavirus occurs much more commonly through respiratory droplets than through contact with contaminated surfaces,” we rather err on the side of caution by: b. Maintain social distancing 
    •   Maintain at least 1 metre distance between yourself and anyone who is coughing or sneezing. When someone coughs or sneezes they spray small liquid droplets from their nose or mouth which may contain virus. If you are too close, you can breathe in the droplets, including the COVID-19 virus if the person coughing has the disease.
    •   Avoid shaking hands or hugging – under the circumstances a verbal salaam will suffice. c. Personal hygiene
    •   Avoid touching eyes, nose and mouth. Hands touch many surfaces and can pick up viruses. Once contaminated, hands can transfer the virus to your eyes, nose or mouth. From there, the virus can enter your body and can make you ill. 
    •   Make sure you, and the people around you, follow good respiratory hygiene. This means covering your mouth and nose with your bent elbow or tissue when you cough or sneeze. Then dispose of the used tissue immediately. Patel said: “It is imperative for Muslims to fully comply with the contingency measures put in place by government. They are put in place as part  of the national disaster protocols aimed at containing the spread of the virus. These are certainly difficult limitations, however we are a community of balance, we take sensible precautions; we tie our camel and trust God. We turn to Him in hope, longing, patience and prayer.”
