A National Health Laboratory Service (NHLS) employee will be disciplined for creating and distributing false and misleading information about the novel coronavirus (COVID-19). On Sunday, 8 March, KwaZulu-Natal Health MEC, Ms Nomagugu Simelane-Zulu condemned the fake news, in which a voice recording of a woman has been widely shared on social media platforms like WhatsApp. ” It alludes to a false scenario of “panic” due to the presence of a number of patients with the novel coronavirus at Prince Mshiyeni Memorial Hospital (PMMH)- something that has been vehemently denied by hospital management,” said Simelane-Zulu. The recorded voice has since been traced to the NHLS employee who faces disciplinary action by both management of PMMH and the state-owned laboratory service. Simelane-Zulu said that she will welcome stringent action against any individual who recklessly spreads false information.
“We are always deeply concerned when people resort to creating and spreading false propaganda, which causes unnecessary fear and anxiety in our communities. This is a sensitive time and government is doing a lot of good work to contain the novel coronavirus from spreading. ” She said that this is a time for cool heads, when we should be expending our efforts and resources on creating awareness about the virus, how it should be prevented, and what people should do if they believe they may be exhibiting its symptoms. Simelane-Zulu said that only the Health Minister, Dr Zweli Mkhize, is authorised to confirm any cases of coronavirus, after laboratory tests have been conducted, and the results received. “It is absolutely vital that Government speaks with one voice on this matter, so that information that goes out to the public is truthful, accurate and credible. We are calling on the society to exercise restraint and act responsibly,” said Simelane-Zulu.
