Following the 2019 April floods, five families in the Silverglen area were removed from their area, which remain unstable. The remaining family, at the block of flats, are edging towards imminent danger as their premises is precariously supported by a slab of weak concrete.Speaking to The Chatsworth Tabloid, Rebecca Shaikh, said: “Our foundation is unstable and the building has cracks. It is only supported by a six inch floating slab of concrete.”The mother of three children, Shaikh, said when it rains the foundation moves, making the house unstable. “My mother in law who is 73-years-old is extremely stressed and my three children stay awake at night in fear of there lives. When it rains, our anxiety worsens. The Housing Department cannot give us a clear directive. Empty promises were made which have never materialised to date. The municipality expects us to be scattered with our children like the rest of the families who moved and are living at the back of Lotus Primary in containers. It is very scary to live here. Ironically, we have a security guard watching the premises, but it will be too late  to save us if something happens,” Shaikh said.Councillor Tony Govender, who has been in discussions with the municipality over the matter, said: “As councilor, I find it quite absurd that the municipality sees it fit to pay attention to unnecessary projects and not this urgent safety issue. They, are failing miserably at the expense of residents lives,”  Govender said. The eThekwini Municipality had yet to respond to the enquiry sent through, by the time of print.
