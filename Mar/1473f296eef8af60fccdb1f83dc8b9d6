With less then 12 hours to go, Ladysmith SAPS officials and key role players are finalizing last minute details, before Ladysmith and the surrounding areas go on a 21 day lock down. “We are serious about the safety of all our citizens and will take action against those that don’t adhere to the 21 day lock down,” said Brigadier Francis Bantham. Roadblocks will be placed at entrances at various points into Ladysmith. Foot patrols will be held and police will be patrolling to make sure that Ladysmith is on a complete lock down. “We as officers will be working closing together with SANDF and Department of Health, to keep our citizens safe from the coronavirus, ” said Bantham. The Brigadier stressed how vital the lock down is, for Ladysmith and the country as a whole. The Ladysmith Herald asked Bantham about the arrest of the patient that tested positive for the corona virus and he said that an investigation is underway, including from the Department of Health. “I do ask that people take note, that there are several allegations being made that people, who are infected are not in quarantine, they should please be careful. Don’t spread it, if you don’t have proof, or if you do have proof, immediately contact the Department of Health, so that proper protocols can be followed,” said Bantham. Bantham stressed that those spreading fake news or any allegations that are untrue, will face the law. “We are aware of several allegations that are being made and are working closely with the Department of Health on these matters, ” said Bantham.
