The first week into the national lockdown and crime reared its ugly head with a fatal shooting claiming the life of a business manager on South Coast Road in Mobeni, just after midday on Saturday, 28 March. “Our Control Centre was alerted to a panic activation and immediately despatched three reaction officers to the scene,” said Blue Security community and media liaison officer, Andreas Mathios. According to Mathios, eyewitness reports state that a man who had been loitering outside the property entered the premises when the gates opened to allow a truck to leave. “The suspect allegedly walked up to the manager who was getting into his car to leave. As he approached the vehicle he pulled out his firearm, fired two shots through the passenger window and then fled on foot. The suspect made his escape by running down a passage between neighbouring buildings. Paramedics responded to the incident but, sadly, the victim was declared dead at the scene,” Mathios said. The motive for the shooting is unclear at this stage Police spokesperson Captain Nqobile Gwala said, “On 28 March, at 12.10pm, a 40-year-old male was found dead with gunshot wounds inside his vehicle at the business premises on South Coast Road, Mobeni. A case of murder was opened at Montclair police station for investigation.”
