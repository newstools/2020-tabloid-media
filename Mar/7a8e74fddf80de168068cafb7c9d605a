In a statement issued by Dr Mkhize, he said that a suspected case of the disease has tested positive by the National Institute for Communicable Diseases. The patient is a 38-year-old male who travelled to Italy with his wife. ” They were part of a group of 10 people and they arrived back in South Africa on 1 March. The patient consulted a private general practitioner on 3 March, with symptoms of fever, headache, malaise, a sore throat and a cough. The practice nurse took swabs and delivered it to the lab, ” said Dr Mkhize. The patient has been self-isolating since 3 March. The couple also has two children.
