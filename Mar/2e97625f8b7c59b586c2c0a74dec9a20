After months of having complaints fall on residents’ deaf ears, members of the Metro Police and DSW have had enough of the illegal dump being deposited at the corner of Electron and Bisasar Road, Springfield. Members of Durban Metro Police and DSW met at the illegal dump site on Thursday, 5 March, in an effort to rid the area of the general waste being dumped there. Although the Durban Landfill Site is just a few minutes away, residents continue to illegally dump their general waste onto the vacant land near Thekwini Springfield College, as a result of the landfill taking mostly rubble instead of general waste. Head of the project, Kriel Nair, expressed his disappointment. He said: “Illegal dumping will under no circumstances be tolerated in this area. We had to close off the road and have a tractor-loader-backhoe clean up the road side as well as the land on which the dumping occurs.” Nair said that it was unfair on the council to continuously carry the cost of cleaning the area, only for residents to start dumping there again hours later. “We have metro patrols here regularly, but it is impossible to have them stationed here 24/7. I have even come up with suggestions such as this land be cleared out to create a taxi rank which would prevent the dumping, however, I don’t see that happening here right now,” said Nair. Superintendent Deon Perumal of Durban Metro who was present at the clean up said that the dumping was unacceptable. “This is the only road that leads to the college and it is an horrific sight to pass. There are individuals who prevent residents from going straight to the dump, leading the residents to dump their waste at the corner of Bisasar and Electron road and then proceeding to sift through the waste in search of anything valuable,” said Perumal. He added, ” If residents are caught dumping illegally, strict action will be taken against the individuals and a fine of up to R5 000 will be issued.”
