Cowan House Preparatory School in Hilton, Pietermaritzburg has been closed today (Friday, 6 March) and all extra-curricular activities have been cancelled.  This comes after it is believed that a parent whose children attend the school was confirmed as the first person to have tested positive for the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) in South Africa. The 38-year-old parent and his wife had traveled with eight other people on a ski holiday to Italy and returned to South Africa on 1 March. The man went to see a private doctor on 3 March with symptoms of fever, headache, malaise, a sore throat and a cough. He was tested positive for COVID-19 on 4 March. The patient and his family have been quarantined at their home and is being monitored by the National Institute of Communicable Diseases (NICD). The doctor has also been quarantined. The Health Minister, Zweli Mkhize said that the patient didn’t show any symptoms when he landed OR Tambo International Airport and travelled by plane to King Shaka Airport. The tracer team has been deployed to KwaZulu-Natal with epidemiologists and clinicians from NICD. The school’s headmaster, Derek Braans said: “At this stage there is limited information available to the school to inform the decision of whether to close the school or not. We have been in constant communication with the experts of the NICD. Their advice has been that it is unnecessary to close the school. Braans said that due to the lack of clarity and uncertainty they have taken the conservative decision to close the school. He said that the closure will afford the school time and the opportunity to obtain additional advice and guidance. “We do not wish to create alarm or unnecessary concern, but feel a conservative action is appropriate under these circumstances.” Braans said further information will be communicated to parents and the community later today (Friday, 6 March). This is a developing story and updates will follow as events unfold.
