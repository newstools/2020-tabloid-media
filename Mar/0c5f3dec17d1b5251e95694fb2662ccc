The long arm of the law last week caught up with a 24-year-old woman who was sought for armed robbery at a jewellery store in Sandton in Gauteng. In July last year police said that jewellery stolen from the House of Ameera at Nelson Mandela Square was worth R8 million. It was reported in July last year that the arrested woman allegedly asked the store manager that she wanted the store’s most expensive watch – a Richard Mille watch worth R2.9 m – which was among the jewellery stolen. An Audermars Piguet watch, which had a price tag of about R500 000 was also stolen. Last week the suspect was nabbed in Amanzimatoti following an intensive intelligence driven operation, conducted by the Provincial Organised Crime Unit, Shongweni K9 Unit and the Alpha Alarms Investigations Unit. Valen Govender, the operations manager at Alpha Alarms said that the suspect was on the run from July 2019. “She evaded police multiple times for about seven months. Last week members of the Alpha Alarms Tracking and Tracing Unit and the company’s Investigation Unit narrowed the suspect’s whereabouts to Amanzimtoti. Through extensive investigation the exact location of the suspect was identified. Members of Alpha Alarms, the Provincial Organised Crime Unit, Shongweni K9 Unit and Crime Intelligence swooped on her at  Beach Road in Amamzimtoti. The woman was detained at Durban Central police station on a Sandton police station case number. Sandton detectives travelled to Durban and took the suspect to the Sandton police station for further investigations,” said Govender. The arrested woman had three accomplices – another woman and two men who are still on the run.
