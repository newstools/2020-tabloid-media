The 7th Annual PMB Ladies Breakfast in support of The Sunflower Fund, is fast approaching. The theme this year is Flower Power – think 60’s, bellbottoms, peace signs and hippie. The fun event  takes place on Friday, 3 April at The Victoria Country Club in Pietermaritzburg from 8.30am to 11am. Guests can also look forward to a fun photo-booth, pamper station, decadent individual desserts, numerous retail therapy pop-up shops, natural oils gift per lady, fabulous goodie bags, guest speakers, surprise treats and loads of exciting prize giveaways. A prize will be awarded to the best-dressed guest.  Funds raised from the event will enable The Sunflower Fund to create awareness as well as educate and recruit more blood stem cell donors. This is fundamental in offering the hope of life to patients suffering from life-threatening blood diseases like leukaemia, who are in need of a blood stem cell transplant from a matching donor. Booking is essential as numbers are limited to 220 guests. To book tickets or sponsor prizes or goodie bag items, contact Mechelle Gindra on 083 328 2688 or email mechelle@mumsmail.com.
