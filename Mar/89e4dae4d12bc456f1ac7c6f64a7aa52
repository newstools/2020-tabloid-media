Two Tanzanian nationals are recovering in hospital after they were rescued on the banks on Zinkwazi Beach on Monday evening, 30 March. First responders, IPSS Medical Rescue, responded to a call at the north coast beach, where there were reports of stranded stowaways having washed ashore. IPSS Medical Rescue spokesperson, Paul Herbst, said on arrival they found two Tanzanian nationals, who had washed ashore. He said: “The men alleged that they had hidden on a vessel that departed Durban port. It is alleged that the crew of the vessel discovered the stowaways and forced the men to leave the vessel after they were given life jackets and a makeshift raft.” Herbst said that the men spent three days at sea before making landfall near Zinkwazi. “The men were treated for exposure and other concerns, and were transported to a local medical facility for further care,” Herbst added. The South African Police Service were called to the scene. An investigation is underway.
