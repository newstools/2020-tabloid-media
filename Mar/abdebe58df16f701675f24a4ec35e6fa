A Ladysmith resident was allegedly arrested by Ladysmith
Police this evening for returning to work instead of self-isolating while
waiting for his COVID 19 test results. It is reported that the man, who owns a business in
Ladysmith, returned from Asia on Tuesday 17 March,  and it is reported that he had shown no
symptoms and had been tested at OR Tambo International Airport on arrival. When arriving in Ladysmith he had a second test done.
Before the results could be confirmed, the patient returned to work on Friday
20 March. A ‘first responder’ paramedic, has spoken to the
Ladysmith Herald under condition of anonymity, saying that he has chosen to
self-isolate after coming into contact with a 39 year old Ladysmith resident. “I had seen him on Monday and so did a few other
people, including children,” said the first responder, who is involved in
emergency response calls of any nature. The first responder told the Ladysmith Herald that he did
not think anything at the time and completed his daily routine and it was
today, Tuesday 24 March, that he received news that he needed to get himself
isolated and tested. “I’m waiting for the NICD to see me in the
morning.” He told the Ladysmith Herald that he is feeling on top of
the world and sounds upbeat about the outcome. At the time of this report, charges were still pending
and police could not comment on the reported arrest. It has been confirmed that people who test positive and
infect others through negligence, may face charges of attempted murder.
Residents are urged to take all necessary precautions and ensure the well-being
of those around them as well as their own.
