Emergency services responded to a report of an accident on the N11 between Newcastle and Ladysmith, in the Tigerskloof area, on Tuesday morning, 17 March, shortly after 5am. The accident happened when a bakkie carrying one male occupant and a number of animals in a vehicle veered off the road and crashed into the bottom of a bridge. On arrival, paramedics from both WATCO Emergency Medical Services and ER24 found the man to be heavily entrapped in the wreckage. The man who was in a serious condition stated to paramedics that the accident occurred at around 4am in the morning. However, emergency services had great difficulty in locating the scene due to the position and location that the vehicle was in. The Newcastle Fire Department and the SPCA were called to the scene to assist with the extrication of the man and the animals that included five dogs and seven cats. Emergency workers were faced with a very difficult rescue due the position of the vehicle and surrounding conditions. The manâ€™s condition deteriorated and he had to be resuscitated inside the vehicle. Unfortunately he later succumbed to his injuries and was declared deceased on the scene. The SPCA managed to rescue most of the animals and they were taken to a facility for further care. The exact cause of the accident is still unknown and will be investigated by the South African Police Services.
