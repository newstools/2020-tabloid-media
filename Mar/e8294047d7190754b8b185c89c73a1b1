In the wake of the coronavirus pandemic, Gift of the Givers is issuing a call to action to all South African citizens, private and corporate, individuals and companies, to come together and support the medical staff and facilities on the frontline, who will be treating those affected by the virus, with crowd-funding on BackaBuddy.The funds raised will be to empower doctors, nurses and medical staff across South Africa with the supplies and equipment needed for them to carry out the vital work they are doing. Founder of the Gift of the Givers, Imtiaz Sooliman said that the aim of the campaign is to support high risk medical professionals in the frontline, dealing with infected patients and themselves through protective equipment, ventilators and other essential supplies in the quest to preserve life.“Right now, there is no emergency, but preparing in advance to support overburdened government health facilities is a reasonable approach in the interest of all South Africans. Hence, the funds raised will be allocated as mentioned, and if we can escape unscathed, then they will still be directed to upgrading emergency services,” said, SoolimanVula Mobile, a network of over 11 000 health professionals in South Africa, has come onboard to help identify the areas in need of support, so that funds can be directed where they are most needed. Since the launch of the crowdfunding campaign on 14 March, a total of R3485.97 has been raised with contributions from seven donors both locally and abroad.
