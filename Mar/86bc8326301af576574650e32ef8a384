“People who open false cases will not be tolerated and will be dealt with harshly. State resources are being wasted on false cases instead of focusing on genuine cases. “All those who still continue to open false cases will be prosecuted,” said the KwaZulu-Natal provincial commissioner, Lieutenant General Khombinkosi Jula. This warning comes in the wake of a reported false carjacking case which led to the ‘complainant’ being charged with perjury. KZN police spokesperson, Colonel Thembeka Mbele, said: “Durban Central SAPS arrested a 24-year-old suspect for perjury. It is alleged that on 26 February, the suspect reported a case of a carjacking at Durban Central. He stated that he was robbed at gunpoint of his vehicle by an unknown suspect. <br />

An intensive investigation that was conducted by detectives revealed that he was not robbed of his vehicle but that it was parked at Berea SAPS. The vehicle was kept at the police station after the driver was arrested for being intoxicated,” Mbele said. She said that the 27-year-old driver was arrested on 26 February just after midnight. “The suspect in the case was the passenger when the arrest was effected. A case of perjury was then opened and the suspect was arrested,” said Col Mbele. The suspect appeared in the Durban Magistrate’s Court.
