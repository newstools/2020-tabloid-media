In the midst of the coronavirus outbreak and national lockdown, an alleged spurned ex-boyfriend was arrested in Phoenix last night (Sunday) after he sought to defame his former girlfriend by posting on social media that she tested positive for Covid-19 and refused treatment. The post went viral on social media and created panic in the community.
Phoenix SAPS communications officer, Captain Louise Naidoo said, “The 32-year-old male was arrested last night after he shared on Facebook that a female was tested positive for the coronavirus and refused treatment. In a statement obtained from the female she stated that the accused is her boyfriend who cannot deal with the break up therefore he put the article on Facebook. “The suspect was arrested after a case in terms of the regulations of the Disaster Management Act was registered. He will be charged and will appear in court at a later stage,” said Captain Naidoo. KZN VIP Security spokesperson Glen Naidoo said that KZN VIP Security received information of a suspect wanted for posting false information. “A sting and joint operation between KZN VIP, Phoenix Detectives and Vispol members led to the arrest of the suspect.  I hope this sends a strong message to every South African that the police will not hesitate to act in such matters. Well done to the police and KZN VIP members on the quick arrest. The family of the victim is grateful for the swift intervention by the respondents,” said Naidoo.
