Residents in Amanzimtoti are urged to be wary of wily suspects who are trying all kinds of tactics to steal what they can. This comes after a suspect entered a Fynn Road yard and opened the lounge window where he allegedly spotted two cellphones to grab. According to reports by the Toti Community Crime Prevention Organisation (CCPO), the suspect used a swimming pool pole to fish the cellphones from the cabinet through the window. The movement caused the television to fall and sent the suspect scurrying through the rear of the property. CCPO Logan and Llewelyn, ET Rapid Response and Blue Security – Durban attended the scene. No arrest was made. In a separate crime incident, a person was robbed by two suspects on the promenade in Amanzimtoti at around 6am on Thursday. A cellphone was stolen, reported the CCPO.
