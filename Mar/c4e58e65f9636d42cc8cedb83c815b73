A lion that had been terrorising the community of KwaYanguye (Sanguye), Melmoth under uMthonjaneni Local Municipality, was shot and killed in a special intensive search operation by Ezemvelo Wildlife game rangers on Monday afternoon, 16 March. The lion had attacked Jabulani Biyela in KuNgqekwane around Hluhluwe-Imfolozi Game Reserve on 3 November, last year. Biyela miraculously survived and spent three weeks in hospital. He has since been discharged from hospital. Speaking to Tabloid Newspapers, KZN Ezemvelo Wildlife spokesperson Musa Mntambo, said that the shooting of the lion was done with a heavy heart. “But lives needed to be kept safe, as it had already attacked a man,” said Mntambo. Mntambo added that a professional hunter was used. He was asked if this could be the same lion that was spotted previously in the Dundee and Vryheid area. Mntambo responded that they were not 100 percent sure if it is the same lion, but so far no other sightings have been made. While news was being awaited from Ezemvelo Wildlife around the shooting, MEC for Economic Development, Tourism and Environmental Affairs, Nomusa Dube-Ncube assured traditional leaders, local communities and all leadership that their safety and the protection of their livestock was priority. MEC Dube-Ncube also added that the damaged fence of Umfolozi Game Reserve has been repaired and this is will also help to protect important species including wild dogs. “We will continue, as a department, to work with leaders across all political lines – traditional leaders, community leaders, communities and nature conservationists. We believe that an integrated approach involving all stakeholders is the only way of making an impact as opposed to working in isolation. Nature conservation is critical in order to provide us with yet another avenue to confront the challenge of unemployment, poverty and inequality,” added MEC Dube-Ncube.
