Recently, the University of KwaZulu-Natal (UKZN) launched the #WeCareUKZN crowdfunding campaign to address the immediate registration needs of students at their campuses. This comes after   it was ascertained that a large number of students are unable to register due to them struggling to pay off their unpaid fees / historic debt. The closing date for registration is Friday, 6 March. Thus far, the university management has made concessions to assist students by reducing the amount payable prior to registration, to a minimum of 15%. However, for many of the students, raising even this minimum fee is near impossible.
 
The university management said: ” We have launched this fundraising initiative to ensure that no academically sound student is left behind. We want to do all we can to raise funds and enable financially disadvantaged students to register by the closing date of 6 March.” 
 
UKZN is appealing to corporates, philanthropic foundations, trusts, alumni, staff and the public to make a difference and contribute to #WeCareUKZN by visiting http://www.backabuddy.co.za/wecareukzn or http://www.donate.ukzn.ac.za. UKZN Foundation – the fundraising arm of the University, will email an acknowledgement and Tax Certificate to all contributors.  The University said that the BackABuddy crowdfunding website has the capacity to receive multiple donations and provides a secure payment system.
