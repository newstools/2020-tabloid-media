KZN MEC for Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs (Cogta) Sipho Hlomuka has reassured residents across the province that essential services provided by municipalities, such as waste removal, water, sanitation, electricity and disaster management, will continue uninterrupted as the province and country embark on a 21 day lockdown as announced by the president to fight against the spread of Covid-19.  The department has issued a directive to municipalities in the province for municipal managers to sign letters which will be given to employees who perform essential services so that they can be able to move around unrestricted as they go about their jobs in line with the Disaster Management Act, 2002. “During this difficult time we are faced with as a province, it is crucial that the sphere of local government plays its part as it is at the coalface of service delivery which is essential to the wellbeing of communities. In the engagements we have had with municipalities, we have emphasised the importance of implementing work from home measures where possible,” said Hlomuka. “The success of the lockdown as announced by Cyril Ramaphosa depends on all of us playing our part as the sphere of local government and the institution of traditional leadership,” added Hlomuka.  The department also continues to support municipalities across the province with the provision of Jojo tanks. Since last April, the department has distributed 2300 Jojo tanks, and R160 millions worth of plant equipment which includes water tankers, waste trucks, honey suckers, TLBs, graders and other equipment with the aim of speeding up the delivery of services.  While the fiscal space in the sphere of local government is constrained, Hlomuka has assured residents that municipalities will do their best to ensure that services are uninterrupted.
