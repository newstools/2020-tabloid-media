The famous city of award-winning Ladysmith Black Mambazo, Ladysmith, was held hostage this week for the third day running as businesses and schools were forced to close their doors while residents remained indoors, due to protest action that brought the city to a standstill. Protesters blockaded main roads leading in and out of Ladysmith with burning tyres and debris. This is the third call this month, for a total shut down in Ladysmith, as residents voice their dissatisfaction with service delivery. The Municipal Manager of Alfred Duma Municipality issued a statement on Friday, 28 February as follows: It is with great concern that we have reached this stage in particular with reference to the “Ladysmith Shutdown” despite having complied and processed all requirements of Ubumbano Lokuthula Organisation. As the Accounting Officer of the Municipality, I hereby wish to confirm that peaceful protest took place on 06 January. On this day Ubumbano Lokuthula Organisation specifically addressed their memorandum to MEC-KZN Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs (COGTA) with the following concerns: On 14 January, COGTA responded as follows: In conclusion, as Council we were expecting a report from Ubumbano Lokuthula Organisation on how far have they complied to the request from COGTA in addressing their concerns which COGTA and the municipality cannot investigate which is the mandate of Law Enforcement Authorities.
We also did not receive service delivery concerns or projects from Ubumbano Lokuthula Organisation which were of their concern and required the municipality to improve on. Issued by the Office of the Municipal Manager: Ms S.S Ngiba
