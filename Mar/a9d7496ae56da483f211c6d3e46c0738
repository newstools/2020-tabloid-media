Residents and business owners across the country can also breathe a sigh of relief as municipalities announced a payment holiday for the nationwide lockdown and beyond. The measures that are being undertaken are meant to reduce economic pressures on vulnerable residents especially during the coronavirus pandemic period.The municipality said that a temporary suspension of all credit control measures and procedures will be implemented until the end of April, which means that electricity meters that were blocked due to overdue accounts will be unblocked giving residents a chance to buy and upload electricity freely during this time. Ethekwini spokesperson, Msawakhe Mayisela said: “Ethekwini metro will not disconnect electricity and water supply until the end of the 21 day lockdown for those who are owing. “ Municipalities have however encouraged residents who can afford to pay for rates and services to do so online and at supermarkets.
