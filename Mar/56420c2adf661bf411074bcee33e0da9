I am aware that sometimes we want special concessions in terms of the number of visitors per bed, but it is imperative, given the gravity of this virus that we do not ignore the rules. I also want to discourage families from taking their children and elderly relatives to hospitals during these visitations as they are most susceptible to the virus. Let’s also adhere to the screening process and not aggravate the process or ignore medical personnel as they are already working under extreme pressure.”
