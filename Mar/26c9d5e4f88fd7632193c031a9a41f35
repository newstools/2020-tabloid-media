After several weeks of DNA testing to authenticate the remains of eight people who were burnt beyond recognition in a horror accident in Blood River, northern KwaZulu-Natal earlier this year, MEC for Transport, Community Safety and Liaison, Mr Bheki Ntuli, met families of four of the deceased to mourn with them the loss of their loved ones. The meeting with the families took place on Thursday afternoon,19 March. MEC Ntuli met with the families of the deceased at the uMfolozi Municipality to offer condolences , support and government services to the families during this period of grief. “This accident was one of the most gruesome accidents I have ever experienced since I assumed office in this department. It pains me that families had to lose their loved ones who had a bright future ahead of them in such a horrific manner. This country has suffered a great loss as the victims would have contributed immensely to the economic growth and prosperity of our province,” said MEC Ntuli. The accident took place when a minibus taxi collided head-on with a BMW on 5 January and upon impact both vehicles caught alight claiming the lives of 10 people. Following the fatal crash only two victims were easily identifiable and DNA tests had to be conducted on the remains of the eight other victims. To-date six victims that were badly burnt have been identified, however, DNA results for two other victims were inconclusive and the tests will have to be repeated. MEC Ntuli further reassured the bereaved families that government was working tirelessly to finalise the DNA testing of the two remaining victims so that all families can find closure and bury their loved ones.
