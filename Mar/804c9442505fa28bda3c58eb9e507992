MEC for Transport, Community Safety and Liaison has strongly condemned the brutal act of cold-blooded murder of five people, which has sent shockwaves throughout the community of Ladysmith, on Thursday, 5 March. Police reported that five adult males were shot and killed inside a house at Ezakheni B-Section at approximately 01.30 am on Thursday morning. The sixth victim sustained a gunshot wound and was taken to a local hospital for medical treatment. The five victims who are not related are aged between 25 to 35. The motive behind the shooting is unknown at this stage but police are following-up on all possible leads. Police are investigating a case of murder and attempted murder. MEC Ntuli has instructed police to act swiftly and deploy all available resources to ensure that those responsible for the heinous crime are brought to book. “I am deeply disturbed by the callous murder of five people at Ezakheni B-Section in Ladysmith and have instructed police to ensure that those behind the killings are arrested. Members of the SAPS are busy reconstructing the murder scene and the docket will be investigated by the Provincial Organised Crime Unit. We urge the community to assist police with information that could lead to the arrest of the perpetrators to ensure that justice prevails,” said MEC Ntuli. MEC Ntuli said there was no evidence at this stage suggesting that the killings were related to taxi violence or the recent protest action that led to the shutting down of the Ladysmith town and which had a negative impact in neighbouring small towns such as Dundee and Newcastle. “We are monitoring the situation in Ladysmith very closely. The SAPS will continue to maintain high visibility in Ladysmith and arrest those involved in criminal acts. Government is committed to addressing all service delivery concerns raised by residents and will continue to engage with stakeholders in order to ensure peace and stability,” added MEC Ntuli.
