An elderly couple were awakened from their slumber to the sight of three suspects, two with firearms, inside their bedroom in Cradlen Gardens, Lenham, recently. Phoenix SAPS communications officer, Captain L Naidoo, said: “It is alleged that three suspects entered the premises by removing the dining room window. All three were armed with firearms and two of them were wearing gloves. They woke the victims both aged 70-years-old and they took them to one of the bedrooms.” According to Naidoo, the suspects wore gloves. “They asked the complainant for the safe key and took R5 000 cash and jewellery to the value of R30 000. They also ransacked all the other rooms and fled taking the victims’ vehicle as well, a white Chev utility bakkie valued at R90 000,” said  Naidoo.Phoenix CPF chairman, Umesh Singh, said: “It is distressing when criminals target the elderly. Thankfully, the victims were not harmed. Residents are urged to be alert and ensure that they have adequate security measures in place to safeguard themselves and their homes in this day and age.”
