EThekwini Municipality has issued a directive to the public to renew their family graves leases and to claim all unclaimed family graves across the city. This is to ensure that all graves that are over 10- years-old are leased by the owners. The municipality has given the public four months commencing from 01 March up to 30 June to lease, claim or renew lease agreements of graves. EThekwini Municipality’s spokesperson, Msawakhe Mayisela, said: “If not, the municipality reserves the right to reuse all unclaimed graves. This will be done with full consideration of other agreements including 20, 25 and 50-year perpetuity leased graves, as most city cemeteries are at a high capacity. ” There are 65 cemeteries and two crematoriums across the city with around 9 600 burials and 1200 cremations taking place annually. The Parks, Recreation and Culture Unit (PRC)is running short of burial space as there are only nine active cemeteries currently and four of them will be in full capacity by end of this year. Multiple burials alternatives can be done at family graves that are being leased. “Alternate solutions had to be sought as the population of Durban is increasing rapidly. Coupled with the high mortality rate, practical solutions are needed, ” said Mayisela. EThekwini Municipal Tariff, permits the PRC to reuse graves older than 10 years. The strategy of utilizing existing facilities for burials is to curb the problem of scarcity of land in the city. The public can renew their leases at the cemetery where the grave is/was leased or clarify any information pertaining to a leased grave, at the cemetery office where the grave is located. Then proceed to Sizakala center to make payment or as advised by the cemetery supervisor.
