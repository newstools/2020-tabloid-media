A 28-year-old man who stabbed his wife several times and abandoned her to die at their home in Watsonia, Tongaat, was arrested on Sunday afternoon, 1 March. Captain Patrick Ngwane, Tongaat police spokesman, confirmed the incident, saying the motive for the murder was unknown. He said it is alleged that the husband Denver Marimuthoo and his 31-year-old wife had an argument on Saturday, 29 February, which led to the murder. “The wife was found lying in a pool of blood at her home. It was established that the couple were involved in an argument when Marimuthoo stabbed his wife multiple times before fleeing in a blue Hyundai i10,” said Ngwane. He said that the husband who was on the run, was nabbed at his parents’ residence in KwaDukuza on Sunday. Ngwane added that the suspect was charged with murder and was supposed to make his first appearance before the Verulam Magistrate’s Court soon. Tongaat Community Policing Forum (CPF) chairperson Nazir Sadack, condemned the incident. “We are saddened by the gruesome discovery, especially as the wife was allegedly killed by someone who was supposed to protect her,” he said. Sadack said the incident happened a day after they had an open trauma session at Tongaat police station. “The session was meant to provide support and comfort for the victims. Attendees were advised to report any form of issue they encounter so that they may receive assistance,” he added. Sadack commended the police for the swift arrest of the suspect. Prem Balram, Reaction Unit South Africa (Rusa) spokesperson, said that at approximately 07.41am on Saturday, their operations center received a call from a property owner requesting assistance after he found his female tenant in an unbearable situation. “Upon arrival, we found the Tongaat SAPS in attendance. We assessed the victim and found that she had already succumbed to her stab injuries,” he said.
