A Chatsworth businessman is due to appear at the Chatsworth Magistrate’s Court this morning, facing a string of charges including the violation of the National Disaster Act. The suspect who was arrested in a mask and protective gear factory raid on Monday in Statesman Drive, Havenside, was taken into custody along with 20 of his employees. His co-accused are believed to be undocumented foreign nationals, employed to manufacture masks among other items following the rise in demand, amid the Covid-19 outbreak. According to police the suspect faces four counts, which include charges of operating a business without a license, employing undocumented foreign nationals without valid permit, failing to comply with the National Disaster Act and operating a business without license. The suspect was in the process of manufacturing masks and protective clothing, when he was arrested by eThekwini Metro Police. The 20 other suspects were arrested for being undocumented, under the violation of the Immigration Act. Meanwhile, in a separate incident, a Chinese national was granted R20 000 bail, at the Durban Magistrate’s Court, and 14 of his employees rescued at another mask factory raid, this week.
