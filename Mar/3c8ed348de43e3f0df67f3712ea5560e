The family of slain Phoenix police officer Theena Pillay who was shot down in cold blood outside a family member’s residence in Woodview, in December last year, welcomed the arrest of a suspect who is alleged to be linked to their loved one’s murder. Phoenix SAPS communications officer, Captain Louise Naidoo, said, “Members from Durban Serious Organised Crime worked on information and several informers were tasked to assist. As a result an informer supplied valuable information. On Thursday, 26 March, members from the Durban Serious Organised Crime and NIU followed up on information regarding a suspect wanted for the murder. Observation was kept in Phoenix and an operational plan was executed. “At about 22.50pm , the suspect was identified and arrested. One cellphone, was recovered. The suspect was interviewed and confessed to his involvement in the planning and execution of the murder,” added Captain Naidoo.
