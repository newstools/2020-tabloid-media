EThekwini Municipality Mayor, Mxolisi Kaunda stepped in to resolve the crisis of the uncollected refuse in the city last week. Mayor Kaunda convened an urgent meeting today (Monday, 9 March) with the leaders of organized labour to find a lasting solution to the problem. ” Residents of eThekwini complained to the municipality about uncollected refuse following a stand-off between the management and workers over the issue of the implementation of overtime changes.

He said that during the meeting both the leadership of the city and unions agreed to reopen consultations around the issue of overtime and that workers will resume their duties while consultations are ongoing. ” The mayor has apologized to the residents for the inconvenience caused and committed the leadership of the city to ensure that the matter is addressed amicably, ” added Mntungwa. The mayor has also asked the Chairperson of the Portfolio Committee on Infrastructure, Human Settlement and Transport, Councillor Thanduxolo Sabelo, to facilitate consultations between labour and management.
