Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs Department (CoGTA) publicly announced the postponement of the Traditional Council Elections, which were scheduled to take on the 29 February. The postponement follows several challenges which have faced the hosting of the elections. On Monday, 2 March, the Department was given the green light by the Pietermaritzburg High Court to continue with the elections following a legal challenge. CoGTA MEC, Sipho Hlomuka said through the postponement, communities will get another opportunity to participate fully in the elections as the legal proceedings created a bit of confusion amongst communities that wanted to participate in the elections. “As a department, we are committed to working tirelessly with Amakhosi to ensure that when the time comes everyone will be able to participate in the important elections which are an opportunity for residents to elect 40 percent of the members of their Traditional Councils,” said Hlomuka. Through hosting the elections, the department will be ensuring that traditional councils are fully reconstituted in-line with the KwaZulu-Natal Traditional Leadership and Governance Act 2005 (Act 5 of 2005).
