Members of the community in Glenwood and Umbilo have been invited to join a WhatsApp group on the coronavirus (COVID-19). The founder of the group Heather Rorick, also the chairlady of Umbilo Community Policing Forum and the Bulwer Safety and Urban Regeneration Forum said that the group has been started for the community and anyone else that comes into the community to work, study, visit or do business. “This group is to keep residents informed, aware and updated on the coronavirus by sharing updated posts, asking questions, speaking on the disease, and just to help people understand this disease and the seriousness it brings to each and everyone of us,” said Rorick. She said that people should understand that the group is not owned by anyone, however it is a WhatsApp group to assist in keeping the community and its residents safe. “If ever there was a time for our community to pull together, it is now. Time to put aside pride, differences, petty issues and spiteful intentions, this is no time for our community to be pulling in different direction. Let’s keep the residents in our community healthy. It all starts by a united community. We can get through this by working together,” said Rorick. She said that she hopes that all other community groups including community and neighborhood watches, community activist and NGO’S encourage and support this community coronavirus awareness and update Whatsapp group.
