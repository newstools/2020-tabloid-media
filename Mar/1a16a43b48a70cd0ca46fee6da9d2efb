The Umdoni Municipality has heeded the call concerning the seriousness of the global outbreak of the coronavirus also known as covid 19 and has implemented stringent precautionary measures to prohibit the spread of the virus by temporarily closing all its public facilities. Sphelele Cele, the communications manager at the Umdoni Municipality said: ” Municipal beaches, swimming pools, libraries, campsites and community halls will remain closed until 15 April.  “However, this period may be extended for the duration of the National State of Disaster as declared by President Cyril Ramaphosa. While the closure may be an inconvenience to local and holidaymakers for Easter, such measures became necessary as the health of the people is a priority.”She added that Mayor Thabani Dube calls upon the different stakeholders that exist within the domain of the municipality to work collaboratively with the municipality in ensuring that all that is humanly possible is done to combat the spread of this virus.He further shared that the municipality is putting measures in place to ensure that the Umdoni community is nourished with information on how to safeguard their health by practicing personal hygiene. “We also reiterate the president’s sentiments on the minimisation of physical contact with other people and to practice social distancing. “However, as we live in such an uncertain period, we urge our residents not to practice social mental and emotional distancing from those they care about. Let us check up on one another and care for one another through available communication platforms and help each other become stronger against the virus,” said Dube. Members of the community that have suspicions of having contracted the virus, can call the National Institute of Communicable Diseases NICD helpline (0800 029 999) and you will be advised on possible testing facilities.
