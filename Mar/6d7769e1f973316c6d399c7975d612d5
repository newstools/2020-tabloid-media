The siege of Ladysmith does not seem to abate despite the recent calls from KwaZulu-Natal Premier Sihle Zikalala for calm and stability to be restored back to the town. In the early hours of this morning (Thursday, 12 March) protestors set fire to six vehicles at the Social Development office, Pieters Bypass. Police and the fire department were called to the scene, but the blaze had already destroyed the vehicles that had been parked inside the office premises. Ladysmith Police came under fire from protestors yesterday (11 March) on Centenary Road as police intervened to stop protestors from closing off the area. Businesses in the CBD area remained closed and residents have been locked down in their homes for fear that matters will get worse. Water has been shut down and schools have closed their doors until Monday (16 March) because of threats made. Social media platforms buzzed with snippets from alleged meetings held, warning people to stay out of the town. Audio recordings said that if the small vehicles are seen driving around, they will face violence from protestors. It is believed that the following roads have been blocked: R103 To Harrismith, R103 to Colenso, Protea Drive, Acaciavale, multiple roads leaving Ezakheni, Pieters road, Centenary road, Umbulwane, Burford, St Chads, Peacetown and Hosland. This is a developing story and updates will follow as events unfold. <br />
