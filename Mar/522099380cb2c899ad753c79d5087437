The eThekwini Central cluster has made an appeal to residents of eThekwini to limit their visits to their local police stations, during the lockdown period, unless the matter is absolutely urgent and is unavoidable. According to eThekwini Central cluster spokesperson, Captain Muzi Maphumulo, the lockdown means that individuals are required to limit their movements in order to prevent coming into contact with other people, during the scourge of the COVID-19 epidemic. Maphumulo also announced that there will be no visitations allowed to their detention centres until the end of the lockdown on 16 April or until further notice. “We appeal to our communities to only come through to the police station if the matter is urgent such as the reporting of serious crimes. Let us use this period to stay at home for our own benefit and that of the nation as a whole,” said Maphumulo. Furthermore, SAPS would like to place on record, for the community’s benefit, that they are complying with the prevention guidelines outlined by the Department of Health, to actively play their part in the prevention of the spread of COVID-19.
