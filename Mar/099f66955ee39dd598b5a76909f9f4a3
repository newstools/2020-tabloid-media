The Health Minister, Zweli Mkhize said today that the number of confirmed coronavirus (Covid-19) cases in South Africa has risen to 554, with 152 new cases. The number of tests conducted are 15 529, the negative cases are 14 975. There are no deaths to date. Mkhize said that two patients are in ICU in private hospitals. He further said that numbers of positive cases are expected to increase in the next week or two. President Ramaphosa in an address to the nation on Monday night,  23 March, called the next few days crucial and requested all South Africans to stay at home from midnight, Thursday, 26 March. It is hoped that the new measures and the nationwide lockdown instituted will flatten the curve, prevent a sharp peak in positive cases and save millions of South Africans from infection and thus save lives. Durban Community activist and secretary-general of the Active Citizens Coalition, Mohammed Ismail, said that while the lockdown was welcomed he remained concerned of its effectiveness. “I believe that huge chunks of some communities remained in denial, or that they feel that they are immune to the coronavirus.”
 
Ismail said that we must adopt the concept of that of an active citizen and take responsibility. “It is only then that we can flatten the curve and help stop the virus spreading. We need to learn to stop debating semantics and get on with the reality of matters. For one, I do not want to held accountable as a person who adds to the spread of the coronavirus,” said Ismail.
