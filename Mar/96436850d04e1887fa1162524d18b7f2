EThekwini Municipality has increased the tariffs by 5% for the hire of City Hall and committee rooms at Sizakala Customer Centres. The implementation of the new tariffs will take effect from 1 July. This came after the Governance and Human Resources Committee, chaired by councillor Nompumelelo Sithole held its monthly meeting at the Durban City Hall on 11 March. Sithole said the increase of booking these venues should not be too hefty considering the economic climate. “Since we are the city that cares for its clients, the venues must be used within the stipulated period reflected on the booking form,” said Sithole.
