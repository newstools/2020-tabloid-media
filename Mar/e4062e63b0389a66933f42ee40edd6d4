The iconic Durban Festival of Chariots 2020 has been postponed to a more appropriate time later this year. The festival was due to take place from 10-13 April in North Beach. The cancellation is due to the uncertainty around the risks of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. The Organizing Committee issued a statement that read: ” In consultation with our internal and external role players, we have  made a carefully considered decision to postpone the festival. The health and safety of our devotees and visitors is top priority. We sincerely thank you for your commitment and assistance with the festival thus far, and ask that you kindly continue enthusiastically with planning and preparation. We pray for the welfare of all during this challenging period and encourage everyone to take care and abide by the protocols and guidelines recommended by the health authorities. ” The Committee said that they look forward to sharing new dates for the festival soon.
