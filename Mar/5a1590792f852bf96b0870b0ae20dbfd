The KZN Legislature in partnership with Uthukela District and Alfred Duma Municipality, Ladysmith SAPS embarked on a coronavirus (Covid-19)Â awareness campaign. The campaign kick started at the Ladysmith Town Hall. It was attended by representatives from the Legislature, Uthukela District mayor, deputy mayor, district leadership and SAPS officials. The stakeholders imparted knowledge and also distributed flyers and soaps to the public, malls and taxi ranks as part of controlling measures and making people aware of the seriousness of the coronavirus pandemic. They provided clear and actionable guidance for operation through the prevention methods by washing hands regularly and use of sanitizers. Since the outbreak of this pandemic, it continues to spread. It is thus important that communities take action to heed the call from the government to prevent further transmission and also support the control measures. While the team was embarking on the awareness campaign they found that some of the shops at the mall were not complying with  regulations as issued by government. There were no sanitisers or safety equipment in place that forced the law enforcement to close down one shop. Also Read:
