The South African Social Security Agency (SASSA) has suspended home, clinic, and hospital visits and encouraged beneficiaries to refrain from collecting grants on 1 April. The agency said this is in line with President Cyril Ramaphosa’s National State of Disaster measures to combat the covid-19 epidemic. SASSA spokesperson, Paseka Letsatsi, said that the situation called for urgent action to be taken when looking at their daily and monthly business as SASSA and South African Post Office (SAPO).“Beneficiaries are requested to avoid collecting their grants on the first day of the month,  due to high pedestrian traffic at shopping malls and other outlets which may pose a health risk during this period,” said Letsatsi.  Letsatsi said that home, clinic and hospital visits by SASSA officials are suspended with immediate effect. “Where a client is above 75 years of age and is bedridden and unable to report to a SASSA office, an application process can be completed under section 15 and Regulation 10 (1) of Social Assistant Act, 2004 to have a procurator or proxy apply on behalf of the affected client. <br />

The application will follow normal process.”He also said that all staff dealing with clients directly will be given all the necessary protective kits to make sure that their health is secured.“SASSA together with SAPO will work closely to implement measures to limit the number of public at post office outlets on the first days of grant payouts,” he said. Letsatsi said SAPO will make sure that the number of clients served will not exceed the set number of 100. He also urged everyone to practice personal hygiene.
