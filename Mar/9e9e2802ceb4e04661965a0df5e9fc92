The search for a Durban hiker has been down graded to local searchers, after rescue teams, Okhahlamba Search and Rescue, SAPS K9 Search and Rescue from Port Shepstone, Newcastle, Vryheid and members of the South African Mountain Club, ER 24, spent the last four days at Monks Cowl, Drakensberg. The search for the 57 year old hiker was called, when he was last seen on Sunday, 15 March. It has been reported that he had gone hiking along Blind Man’s corner, which is situated in Central Berg.
