A Tongaat man who allegedly stabbed his wife to death at their home on Sunday, is expected to apply for bail next week. Denver Marimuthoo, 28, husband of Roxanne Thanthoni made his brief appearance at the Verulam Magistrate’s Court yesterday, Tuesday, 3 March. The case was postponed to 10 March for bail application. The 31-year-old wife was also laid to rest yesterday. It is understood that the newly-weds, Marimuthoo and Thanthoni had an argument in the home on Sunday morning, 1 March. Their landlord Ashwen Beerbel found Thanthoni with stab wounds facing down in a pool of blood at their home in Watsonia Drive, Tongaat. Marimuthoo was arrested at his parents’ home later that day. Marimuthoo kept his head down as he entered the dock. Dressed in a formal blue shirt and white jeans, he appeared on the brink of tears as the magistrate asked about his legal representation. The suspect replied that he would opt for legal aid. Lewhan Reddy, Legal Aid attorney, then told the court the accused would be seeking bail. Sabelo Ziqubu, State Prosecutor, assured that they will oppose it due to the seriousness of the charges. Dolly Munien, the deceased’s aunt and ward councillor, said the whole family was saddened by the incident. “We want to see the murderer pay for what he did. We will leave the law to take its course,” she said. Munien described Thanthoni as a grateful woman, who was loved by many.
