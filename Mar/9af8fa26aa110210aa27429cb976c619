There was great excitement at the Dundee Civic Hall at the graduation ceremony of 74 Emergency Service (EMS) officers who graduated from the KZN College of Emergency Care on Saturday, 7 March. The EMS officers completed a four month skills-based course, which has up-skilled them from Basic Life Support (BSL) to Intermediate Life Support (ILS). Their new qualification will allow them to resuscitate patients with cardiac arrest and do uncomplicated breech delivery amongst other competencies. KwaZulu-Natal Health MEC Nomagugu Simelane-Zulu congratulated them and said: ” “Your graduation is indeed a quantifiable improvement in service delivery and quality of care. It means that from today onwards, the people of KwaZulu-Natal now have an enhanced level of pre-hospital patient management,” Simelane-Zulu said. MEC Simelane-Zulu said the paramedics were now skilled and competent in providing intermediate medical interventions, such as:
• Nebulisation of patients, with specified medication
• Administration of scheduled drugs
• Administering drips for dehydrated patients, both adults and paediatrics
• Administration of oxygen with specified devices
• Resuscitation of patients in cardiac arrest and none cardiac arrest situations
• Defibrillation in certain cardiac arrest situations
• Management of patients with a decompression of the chest; and
• Conducting uncomplicated breech delivery and normal delivery during labour. The MEC said that the graduation came at an important time for EMS as changes for improvement take place. Government, through the Health Professions Council of South Africa, is phasing out all short courses that were offered by public colleges to align the qualification with South African Qualifications Authority (SAQA); professionalise EMS education and training and improve standards.
