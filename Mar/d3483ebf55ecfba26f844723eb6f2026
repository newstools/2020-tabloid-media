The Malvern SAPS with Metro Queensburgh held a successful roadblock operation on 4 March. Station commander Lieutenant  Colonel Valerine Reddy said the operation charged 30 people for drunk driving and two for possession of heroin. “The unit moved the operation to different spots in Malvern thus saturating all the focal points and ensuring all areas of the Malvern patrol area were covered,” said Reddy.  “As the Easter holidays draw closer, road users must be forewarned that roadblocks of this nature will become the norm. This is in keeping with the end result which is safer roads for all and falls within the mandate of the SAPS and Metro,” said Reddy.  The success of the operation was attributed to the excellent teamwork of the different units.
