A number of shoppers and commuters who ventured out on the first day of the 21-days lockdown, were left stranded outside shops and ranks across Durban on Friday afternoon, 27 March. According to strict measures, issued by Transport Minister, Fikile Mbalula, limiting movement, public transport including buses and taxis would only be available in the morning from 5am to 9am and then once again in the afternoon from 4pm to 8pm. Shoppers and commuters have during that period to travel via public transport, to go to work if you are part of the essential services industry, go to supermarkets to purchase essential items or to a hospital for medical treatment. On Friday afternoon a number of shoppers were seen sitting on pavements or walking the empty streets with their shopping bags. Jabu Khumalo from Avoca Hills, who was among those stuck outside the supermarket opposite Durban Station, said she was disappointed with the way things turned out.  “I really never thought I would be stuck like this. It is now 2.45pm and there is no transport to take us back home,” she said. With  mixed feelings Khumalo said she understood the purpose of the lockdown. However, like many South Africans Khumalo said this was her first  opportunity to shop after getting paid. Khumalo  said:”I thought coming to town would be easier, to get everything done all at once. I understand why there is a lockdown and the need for it,  but I can’t help but feel hurt by it. I’m stuck here because there is no transport to take me home.” The  long distance taxi rank next to the supermarket, was also quieter than normal. Taxi drivers loitered outside their minibuses, waiting for 4pm.
