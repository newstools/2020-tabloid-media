Power failures have been reported affecting the Ezakheni Water Treatment Plant, in the last 48 hours, leaving most of Ladysmith and surrounding areas without water. In a press release, issued by the Corporate Stakeholder Management Unit, Office of the Chief Executive, Umgeni Water Head Office, Pietermaritzburg, it is reported that at least four electricity supply interruptions were experienced at the Ezakheni Water Treatment Works in Ladysmith, which is operated by Umgeni Water. This occurred on the Eskom supply line and it impacted on abstraction of raw water and potable water production at the plant. Due to the power supply failures, the plant was not able to operate at optimum, resulting in reduced potable water supply to the two receiving reservoirs, Assvoelkop and Abattoir.  
 
Some areas in Ladysmith that are supplied by these reservoirs have been affected. Potable water production at the Ezakheni Water Treatment Works is now back to normal following restoration of power supply. The problem relating to power supply failures was outside of Umgeni Water’s control. “Umgeni Water fully understands consumers’ concerns over the absence of water supply and apologises for any inconvenience that may have been caused,” said Umgeni Water .
