GladAfrica Championship side Uthongathi have decided to part ways with their coach Johnny Ferreira ahead of a top-of-the-table clash against Swallows FC. The club released a statement on Wednesday stating that the decision to release Ferreira was due to unfortunate results. “Uthongathi Football Club wishes to announce that we have parted ways with John George Ferreira. We have worked with Mr Ferreira for two seasons. He is a marvelous coach packed with experience. He lives and dreams football but unfortunately the results weren’t coming,” read the statement from the club management. The release of Ferreirra from the club came in the backdrop of the league’s unfortunate five draws in a row. Cane Cutters led the NFD early on in the season, but a sequence of just one win in their last eight league matches as well as a Nedbank Cup exit against Highlands Park has led to the departure of the coach. Third-placed Uthongathi, just a point behind second-placed Swallows, are due to meet at Dobsonville Stadium on Saturday, but will now be without their head coach. The club confirmed that assistant coach Sifiso Dladla will take over the reins alongside goalkeeper coach Olivier Kouadio, for the remainder of the season.
