An Uber driver was accosted with weapons by two ‘passengers’ on Millbury Place in Eastbury, recently. Phoenix SAPS communications officer, Captain L Naidoo, said: “The complainant alleges that he received an uber request and upon arrival at Millbury Place, two unknown men stopped his vehicle and jumped inside. One suspect pulled out a knife placing it on the driver’s neck while the other drew a firearm. One suspect switched off the vehicle’s engine and jumped to the driver’s seat instructing the driver to sit at the back.” Naidoo said that according to the complainant, the suspects drove around for about 15 minutes and stopped. “They instructed him to close his eyes and count to ten. When he opened his eyes, the suspects disappeared. The driver drove home and discovered that the suspects took his Samsung cellphone,” said Naidoo. An armed robbery case is under investigation at Phoenix SAPS.
