Good hygiene practices was one of the highlights during the presidential address regarding the fight against COVID-19, on Sunday.With 116 reported cases of the virus on the cards at the time of going to print, South Africans are making their cautionary move to stock up on as much hygiene products as they possibly can, in an effort to prevent the transmission of the virus.It has been established, by the World Health Organisation (WHO), that the virus is spread through droplets released when someone sick coughs or sneezes that comes in contact with oneâ€™s mouth or nose area. In order to combat this, the president has urged South Africans to wash their hands frequently with soap and water or hand sanitisers for at least 20 seconds, to cover their nose and mouth when coughing and sneezing with a tissue or a flexed elbow and to avoid close contact with anyone who shows cold or flu-like symptoms.After this golden nugget of advice from the president, stores nationwide have been inundated with shoppers making a beeline for the hygiene aisle and almost clearing them out daily. Some shoppers believe that this is a selfish act as personal hygiene should have always been a priority as a human being, and that the spread of the virus should not be scaring people into depriving others of utilising these products as they have before. The president has, however, assured South Africans that this epidemic will pass and that if we act as a united front, we will overcome it.
