For the past three months the uThukela District Municipality had several sewer pump stations that have been damaged and vandalised in the Steadville, Ladysmith and Colenso areas. All the stations have been stripped off electrical cables for copper, cabling and motors. A newly refurbished station in Steadville has been subjected to cable theft and severe vandalism. This happened even before Alfred Duma municipality could connect electricity. The pump station has been damaged and all electrical cables have been cut and removed rendering the station non-functional. The Amarula sewer pump station in Acaciavale has also suffered vandalism where all electrical equipment were damaged. Four Colenso sewer pumps were vandalised and electrical panels and cabling damaged. District Mayor Councillor Siphiwe Mazibuko said the acts of vandalism and theft has crippled the working order of the stations. ” We also had more damages at Leonardsville sewer pump station. This station has been vandalised for the tenth time now. The damages are far more than R1 million rand. We have since reported the matter to the Ladysmith police for investigation, ” Mazibuko. All the pump stations showed terrible signs of forced entry as they are kept locked all the time. All the above incidents have been reported to the police and the case numbers obtained. These acts of vandalism is crippling service delivery. It is also tantamount to treason as such tactics are generally employed by saboteurs to unseat the government of the day. “We call upon the public to assist us to curb these acts and help to bring perpetrators to justice by reporting acts of vandalism to the police,” said Mazibuko.
