The Independent Communications Authority of South Africa has been in negotiations with network service providers to reduce its data prices for consumers. Vodacom has agreed and will be implementing a price drop as from 1 April. The Westville Weekly Gazette took to the streets to ask consumers what they think of Vodacom’s data price drop? Nasiha KhanDespite Vodacom’s decrease in prices, we are still being scammed, if you have to compare our data prices to other countries, we pay so much more, it’s ridiculous. I think these companies take advantage of our compliance and something needs to be done about this.Matt TsoloI am happy that they are dropping their prices, they have been the most expensive network provider in the country. As much as  it is about a 30% cut, it doesn’t mean they are the cheapest, but at least customers can be relieved a little bit.Mandisa Mchunu This is great news from Vodacom, especially for us as students. Vodacom prices are ridiculously high and not affordable. Maybe now with these adjustments, I can finally afford buying data from them.Sphokazi Gcabashe Vodacom has finally done what they were supposed to do ages ago. The high prices were not only affecting us as customers, but their business as well. They were too expensive and people had shifted to cheaper networks. Kerry BrissettI am somewhat excited about the Vodacom data 30% drop in price as I only use data during my social time. I use wifi at home and in the office which is really the cheapest way to go. According to my daughter, Vodacom’s data prices are slightly more than their competitors that’s why she doesn’t use Vodacom. I do hope that Vodacom drops their call prices by 30% then I would be ecstatic.
