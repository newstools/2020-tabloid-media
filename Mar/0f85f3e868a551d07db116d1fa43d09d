After a relatively short break of power cuts, Eskom announced yesterday (10 March) that initially there would be stage 2 load shedding implemented with foreseeable power cuts for the rest of the week. This comes after it was established that there have been delays in returning some generation units which were expected to return to service the previous day. However, these units would only return during the course of the week. This has strained the system which required a continuation of load shedding. Incidentally, a few hours after the initial statement was released from the country’s main energy source, Eskom  informed South Africans, to their dismay, that load shedding would now be increased to stage 4 as of 2pm yesterday. Eskom’s reason was that the Koeberg Unit 1 had tripped and became disconnected from the grid. They said that this was due to a fault on the turbine side, however, the nuclear reactor remained safe. Eskom said that there are teams investigating the root cause of the fault and will advise of the remedy as soon as it is established. It was later established that the seawater circulating pump was also damaged and Eskom said that repairs were expected to take place before the unit is up and running again. Twitter was abuzz as users expressed their views on the recent power cuts: Neo Jolinkomo Mda (@neozaneozaMda) tweeted: “What happened to Medupi? I thought this was a new state of the art, high tech power station build recently. I think this is done on purpose to derail this ailing economy.” Ben Keyser (@benkeyser) added: “Eskom’s total business model is built on delays and excuses. You inherited a good infrastructure which you now lament is “ageing”. If you weren’t so absorbed in your gravy train and maintained what you had, things would have been in a much better operational state.” Meanwhile, Eskom has appealed to the public to visit their load shedding schedules on their local municipality websites to review amendments.
