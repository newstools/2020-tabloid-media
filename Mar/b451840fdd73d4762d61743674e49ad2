Ward 25 councillor, Hassan Haniff regrettably informs the communities of Springtown and Asherville that the meeting which was scheduled to take place at the David Landau Hall on 25 March will no longer be taking place.As circulated, residents were informed that the crime and ratepayers meeting would include addresses from Metro Police and SAPS as well as a crime election for a captain on each road and an election for a ratepayers forum.“Due to the restrictions placed on the country by President Ramaphosa, we cannot expect residents and our task force to appear in public despite the order to cancel all public gatherings exceeding a crowd of a 100 people,” said Haniff. The public will later be informed if the meeting will reconvene on another date after the pandemic is under control.
