Blue Security in partnership with Pinetown police, SAPS crime Prevention and Customs, SARS customs drug detection dogs have been busy with sniff-and-search operations in various schools in Durban and surrounding areas.Recently, the teams visited a school in Pinetown where a search and crime prevention programme was carried out.Russell Lawson, Blue Security’s tactical ambassador for the highway area said: “The carefully orchestrated exercise had a surprise element as the team arrived at the school unannounced, to carry out the search for any possible illegal drugs and contraband items.” Lawson said that on arrival, the two furry canine “narcotics detectives” heading the search, immediately got down to business by sniffing their way through the school’s premises. “Each classroom, pupil and schoolbag was inspected by the highly trained dogs accompanied by their handlers.The search-and-detect operation was a huge success and the school was proud to hear that no illegal substances were found and no arrests needed to be made,” said Lawson. He said that the goal of these search exercises is to have 100% success rate at each institution involved in the Safer Schools Programme in the greater Pinetown area.“We want to be proactive and institute preventative measures by educating pupils about the dangers of being in possession of, or using, drugs and contraband items. Blue Security, in collaboration with the major law-enforcement units, really want to make a difference in the area by emphasising a zero – tolerance approach to drugs.“Various schools are participating in the programme in an effort to combat the drug problem so prevalent amongst many of today’s younger generation. This will also contribute to providing safer schools for each and every pupils,” Lawson said.
