Five alleged hijackers were killed in a fatal high-speed crash involving police on the M7 highway recently. Officers from the Durban K9 Unit were following up on a stolen vehicle that was used in a number of crimes within the Pinetown, Umbilo and Berea areas, when they spotted a car speeding towards Bellair. KwaZulu-Natal police spokesperson Colonel Thembeka Mbele said that is when they acted and pursued the suspects. She said; “A chase then ensued between the suspects and the police towards the Malvern area. The suspects’ vehicle crashed on a concrete light pole and brick wall where it capsized on Woodlands Avenue in Bellair while they were firing shots at the police.”
Mbele said that all five suspects were declared dead at the scene of the crash and that three unlicensed firearms with six rounds of ammunition were also recovered. Further investigations revealed that the suspects were positively linked to a business robbery committed on the day of their demise, in which a vehicle and other belongings were taken from a business premises. Mbele said that the deceased were also linked to a carjacking in which a motorist was robbed of his vehicle in Pinetown. “The preliminary investigation gathered at the scene also revealed that the said vehicle was taken during a house robbery at Newlands East in June,” Mbele added. Provincial Commissioner, Lieutenant General Khombinkosi Jula said that he was concerned about the brazen acts of the suspects which eventually led to their demise. “It is quite disturbing to see police officers being attacked while executing their duties. The police officers will defend themselves when they come under attack. I am glad that no injuries were sustained by the team,” Jula said.
