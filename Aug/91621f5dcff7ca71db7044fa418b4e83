With the growing numbers of Covid-19 positive cases worldwide, The Association For The Aged (Tafta) recently announced that they have a total of 27 elders who tested positive for Covid-19 and six staff members to date. 14 of the 27 elders have fully recovered and the three staff members as well. Tafta CEO Femada Shamam, said that with the recoveries, two people have died; Tafta on Ridge and another at Cambridge Gardens.
“Sadly, a Tafta Park elder who recovered from the virus and was retested and found to be negative, passed away following a medical procedure performed early last week. We wish those families mourning their losses strength and fortitude over this very difficult time,” said Shamam. She appealed to the community to continue keeping the elders in prayers, praying for their strength as many face this difficult time alone whilst in isolation. “We continue to monitor those elders who are positive and work with the Department of Health (DOH) to screen and test those elders identified as high risk.
If you are able to assist us with the ongoing containment of the virus, either through a sponsorship of disposable containers (used to feed elders in isolation) or donations towards our ever-increasing care costs, please visit www.tafta.org.za, ” said Shamam.
