Montclair Trio Crimes detectives are working around the clock on clues to arrest the perpetrators involved in an armed house robbery on Montclair Road where a slumbering mum and her children were rudely awakened by three intruders, recently. Montclair SAPS communications officer, Captain Derek Vijiam, said that at 3am the victim was asleep in her house on Montclair Road, when she heard noises emanating from her lounge. “She (the mum) awoke the kids and pressed the alarm, however, the alarm did not activate. The complainant went to her lounge and found three unknown males inside the house. One had a firearm in his hand. She immediately returned to her bedroom and locked the door behind her. A few minutes later she was instructed by the suspects to open the door which she did. The suspects removed all electronic equipment including cellphones and laptops and left. After a few minutes, they returned and began to search the house again. They took a wrist watch and takkies. The suspects fled from the scene using a white Polo,” Cpt Vijiam added. Meanwhile in a separate incident, at approximately 2h30am, a victim was asleep with her baby in an outbuilding in a property on Anleno Road, Montclair when she heard voices outside her door. “She screamed for help and in the ensuing process two unknown males entered her property, by gaining entry through a bent burglar guard and a broken door. The assailants threatened the victim verbally while one of the males pointed a firearm at her. They demanded cash and electronic equipment. Thereafter they ran to a white Polo and made their getaway. SAPS Montclair Trio Crime detectives are working on leads which will result in an imminent arrest,” said Cpt Vijiam.
