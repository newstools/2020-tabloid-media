 A screaming guard at a school in Palmview was found tied to a staircase after four suspects allegedly armed with knives accosted him and attempted to break into an office on the school premises, on Saturday. KZN VIP spokesperson, Gareth Naidoo, said: “On Saturday, at approximately 2.05am, KZN VIP Phoenix based control centre received multiple telephone calls from members of the public informing them that they heard screams for help emanating from the school premises. Immediately, all available Reaction Officers were dispatched to investigate further. “Upon arrival, Response Officers heard cries for help coming from inside the school and the members jumped over the fence to investigate. Upon searching the office area, they discovered a security officer tied at a nearby staircase. Response Officers untied the security officer and upon interviewing him it was established that four suspects armed with knives and a crowbar had attacked the security officer and attempted to force open an office on the second floor. They were unsuccessful when the security officer alerted neighbours by screaming,” Naidoo said. He added: “Response Officers conducted an extensive search in the dense bush situated behind the school grounds but no arrests were made. The security officer sustained no injuries visible but he was assessed by medics. Police were on scene.”
