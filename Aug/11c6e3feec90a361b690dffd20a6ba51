The management of Parkview Primary School, in Woodhurst, is appealing to the public, to assist the school financially. Principal of the school, Mr Y Perumalswami said that the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic has resulted in non-payment of schools fees. “Schools have also been instructed to terminate the lease agreements with all tenants and the rental income has been the most important source of income for Parkview Primary School,” he said. The school was largely dependent on fundraising to supplement the school’s income. Furthermore, the teachers employed by the school governing body have had to accept salary cuts due to the reduced income of the school. Perumalswami said that the future shows no light at the end of the tunnel if there is no change in the financial growth of the school. “If there is no change in our financial situation, Parkview Primary School will be forced to let go of our SGB teachers and caretakers, thus compromising our education. This goes against the vision of our school. These are also individuals who are breadwinners of their homes,” said the principal. The school humbly appeals to their parents, the greater Woodhurst community, ex-learners, ex-teachers, ex-principals and all interested parties to assist them financially during this difficult period. “We are appealing for financial assistance and any services that will uplift our school and our community at large. Notwithstanding all these difficulties, our teachers have shown their commitment and dedication throughout this pandemic by ensuring that pupils are receiving quality education through online teaching. We urge you to consider our plight and make a contribution to ease our financial burden,” added Perumalswami.
