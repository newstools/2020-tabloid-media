The King Shaka International Airport (KISA) has warned all job seekers to not fall victim of vacancy scams that are currently being advertised on their behalf. In a Facebook post, KISA said that credible job vacancies are only advertised on their official website, www.airports.co.za “Please be advised that we are experiencing job vacancy scams. Our vacancies are only advertised on our website. Any vacancy that has a fee attached to it must always be considered a scam. If the job vacancy advert includes a Gmail email address, it is a tell-tale sign that it is a scam,” said KISA. “We do not list multiple positions in one advert, a vacancy will be specific to one job per vacancy. Our staff have a Grade 12 minimum qualification. “We never use Gmail email addresses or cellphone numbers.You do not pay to apply for vacancies,” KISA added.
