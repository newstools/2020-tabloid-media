Intense police investigations into the murder of an unborn baby resulted in the arrest of two suspects following the June armed robbery where a pregnant woman was shot by a stray bullet in Cato Crest. Last Tuesday, police officers from Cato Manor SAPS made the breakthrough when they arrested the two murder suspects aged 21 and 33. Provincial police spokesperson Colonel Thembeka Mbele said that it is alleged that on 14 June at 9.30pm, the victim was walking along the road in Cato Crest when two unknown men tried to rob him. “The victim tried to run away but he was shot in the thigh. A stray bullet struck a pregnant woman who was seated inside a room and she sustained a gunshot wound to the stomach. Both victims were rushed to the hospital for medical attention. Unfortunately, the unborn baby was certified dead two days after the incident,” Mbele said. A case of murder and attempted murder was opened at the Cato Manor police station for investigation. “Intensive investigations were conducted which led the police to Westville Prison where the suspects were arrested and charged for murder and two counts of attempted murder. The same suspects were initially arrested for house robberies that were committed in the same area,” said Mbele.
Both suspects appeared in Durban Magistrate’s Court on charges of murder and attempted murder. “These suspects will be profiled to determine if they can be linked to similar cases in the area,” Mbele added. The KwaZulu-Natal provincial commissioner, Lieutenant General Khombinkosi Jula praised the members for the arrest of the suspects who were terrorising the community.
