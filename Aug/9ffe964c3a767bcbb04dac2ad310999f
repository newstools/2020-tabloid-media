Merciless armed robbers accosted a Durban resident, hit him with the firearm across his face and fled with his vehicle, in a robbery at a business premises in Overport, recently. “Blue Security reaction officers responded to a callout and on arrival discovered the injured man,” said Blue Security community and media liaison officer, Andreas Mathios.
“Five armed suspects entered the property shortly before 4.30pm and assaulted the victim by pistol-whipping him across the face. The gang stole the victim’s wallet and two cell phones before fleeing in his vehicle. The stolen vehicle was later recovered by the tracking company in Moore Road. Berea SAPS attended the scene and investigations are continuing,” he added In a second unrelated armed robbery, a store manager was brutally assaulted by suspects masquerading as customers at a store in the Durban Central Business District, recently. “Three armed suspects entered the store posing as customers and accosted the manager, pointing firearms at him,” Mathios said. The manager was pushed into the back office where he was violently assaulted by the suspects. The men fled the store with an undisclosed amount of cash. “The injured victim was transported to hospital for further treatment. Durban Central SAPS attended the scene,” Mathios added.
