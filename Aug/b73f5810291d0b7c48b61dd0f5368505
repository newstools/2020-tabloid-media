Police have noticed an increase in reported cases of theft of motor vehicles in the patrol precincts of Merewent, Wentworth and Merebank, recently. Wentworth SAPS communications officer, Captain MP Gumede said: “The vehicles referred to are stolen from the public parkings as well as sidewalks or near the pavements in residential areas or in industrial parking lots. The vehicles which have been reported stolen are mostly bakkies which include Ford Ranger double cabs, Toyota Hilux double cabs, Ford Ranger and light motor vehicles of different makes.” “The modus operandi or method used by the suspects is the breaking/ tampering of door locks and also tampering with ignition. The community in Merewent area must also ensure that after parking, the alarm system is activated and all valuables inside the vehicle are kept away since it also draws attention and results in a break-in into the vehicle. The community must also be aware that Cuttings Beach is still under construction and those who are going there for fishing must secure their vehicles since there is no entrance in order to park near the beach. The motorist or vehicle owners therefore have to park far away from the beach, leave their vehicles a distance away and walk to the beach. By the time you return, your vehicle may be stolen,” said Cpt Gumede. “We have advised that fishermen be dropped off and be picked up if possible in order to reduce the crime of theft in that area as well. Vehicles have also been stolen in Cuttings Beach at the side parking. The police patrols are being done but we need to work together with the vehicle owners and community members to curb the theft of motor vehicles,” Cpt Gumede added.
