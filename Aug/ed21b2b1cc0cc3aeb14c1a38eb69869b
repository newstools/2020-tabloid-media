A mother has appealed to the community of Tongaat and neighbouring Inanda to help find her missing daughter. She reached out to private security company Reaction Unit South Africa (Rusa), appealing for assistance in locating her child Nosipho Milazi, 16, who ran away from home. Milazi, who lives with her grandmother in Vanrova, Tongaat, left home two weeks ago and has not been seen by her family since. According to Rusa, on the day that Milazi left home, she packed her bags and took her clothes with her. She was in the company of an unknown man believed to be her boyfriend. Prem Balram of Rusa, said that Milazi contacted her mother last Thursday, 20 August, claiming that she was being held against her will in Inanda. “The man phoned the mother again stating that the teenager had stolen his phone and he demanded payment of R1 200 for her release. Milazi spoke to her mother and denied the theft. She also informed her mother not to pay the money,” he said. Balram said that Milazi’s mother then received another phone call from a different man the following day. The caller said that he had assisted Milazi to get away from her captor but asked for a payment of R900, for his role in the rescue.
“Milazi spoke to her mother and asked her to pay the money, but told her that she will not be present during the exchange. Milazi went on to explain that she will meet her mother after she pays the money and she did not sound as if she was under duress,” Balram said. He added that the mother fears that her daughter may now be on drugs and using the alleged kidnap to extort money from her, however this cannot be confirmed.
