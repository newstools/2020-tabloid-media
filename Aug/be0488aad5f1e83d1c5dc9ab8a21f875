 A 30-year-old man endured a traumatic ordeal and was taken to hospital in a critical condition when his arm was lodged in a concrete mixer at an industrial site in Phoenix resulting in a partial amputation of his limb, on Friday. Life Response 24/7 spokesperson Leon Fourie, said reports from the scene indicated the man had been working on a concrete mixer when his arm became lodged causing a traumatic injury. “When emergency care practitioners arrived on the scene the man’s colleagues had managed to free his arm, however, on clinical inspection it was ascertained that he had suffered a partial amputation. Advanced life support intervention was needed to stabilise him before he was airlifted with the assistance of the Netcare911 aeromedical helicopter, to Umhlanga Hospital for the further immediate care he required,” Fourie added. “The exact cause of the accident and the events preceding it are unclear and will form the subject of a departmental investigation,” he said.
