The discovery of a fourth body in the South Coast during the past six months has sparked fears of a serial killer operating in the area with police not ruling out the possibility of this being true. The latest victim was found in the village of Mnafu in Mtwalume on Tuesday and the deceased was naked. The decomposed body was discovered by a woman who was collecting wood and stumbled upon the grisly find. The victim was identified as Zama Chiliza. Police spokesperson, Colonel Thembeka Mbele said: “An inquest was opened at Hibberdene police station for investigation. On 11 August at 11am police received a complaint of a murder at Mnafu in Hibberdene and proceeded to the scene. On arrival they found the decomposed body of a woman believed to be in her late thirties. A post-mortem will be conducted to determine the cause of death.” According to media reports, it is also not clear when the woman went missing but two identity documents and a clinic card dated 21 May were found in her possession.
The police forensic team and sniffer dogs scoured the scene for any possible leads that could assist in the investigation which has the community up in arms as they are panicked that a serial killer roams in their midst. Previous findings into the South Coast killings reveal that two bodies were found in sugarcane fields at Mnamfu in April during lockdown while the body of a third woman was found in July in a sugarcane field in Nomakhanzana.
