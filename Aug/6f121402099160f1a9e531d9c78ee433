After decades as a home for preloved goods, Tafta Granny Attic Shop will be closing its doors on Monday 31 August. Tafta CEO Famada Shamam announced the news recently. She said that the shop was run by Tafta staff and having to close it doors brings them great sadness. “The Granny Attic Shop has been a landmark for many Tafta residents, supporters and donors. We appreciate every member of the public, volunteers and staff who passed through our doors. The dedication and generosity shown towards the shop leaves us with heart-warming memories of the past and hope for future support.” Shamam said that Tafta has partnered with the Social Cause Agency who will continue the sale of items donated to Tafta. “The Social Cause Shared Charity Shop is based in Pinetown on 36 Bamboo Lane, and was established by the agency as a non-profit organisation to resell donated items from a shared location. They have now accepted Tafta as a beneficiary and our loyal donors are encouraged to donate their beloved goods to the shop, which will then be sold in honour of Tafta’s Needy Pensioner’s scheme. The scheme helps Tafta support those elders subsisting only on a state pension for their well-being,” said Shamam.
