Sydenham detectives are investigating the arrest of five wanted house break-in suspects in Reservoir Hills on Monday afternoon and are working tirelessly to link them to other crimes. Sydenham SAPS communications officer, Captain Myen Lazarus, said that on Monday at about 3.30pm, Sgt Nxumalo, Cst Chilli and Cst Jele were patrolling up Mountbatten Drive and at Battersea Avenue when they noticed a silver Toyota ND 793661 with five occupants proceeding down Mountbatten Drive. “Sgt Nxumalo immediately turned the patrol vehicle around and eventually stopped the said vehicle at the corners of Riddick and Mountbatten Drive. The members realised this vehicle had been circulated as wanted for Armed Robberies in the Sydenham and Newlands areas. Upon searching the occupants, four unlicensed firearms all with live rounds in the magazines were recovered. Municipal work wear were also found in the vehicle. The suspects were arrested and charged accordingly,” Lazarus said. He said that the firearms which included two Norincos, a Griphan and one unknown make together with magazines and 38 rounds were entered as exhibits in the SAP 13 register. “Upon inspecting the firearms it was found that all serial numbers had been filed off. The cellphones and municipal wear were also entered as exhibits. “It is believed that this gang was responsible for several house breakings/house robberies committed in the Springtown and Asherville areas. Detectives are working on connecting suspects to more cases,” Cpt Lazarus said. Any victims of these arrested perpetrators from other areas are urged to contact Sydenham SAPS on 031 203-2703 or if any Westville residents have fallen victim to the gang are urged to contact Captain Rob Holmes with case numbers on 031 267 7343.
