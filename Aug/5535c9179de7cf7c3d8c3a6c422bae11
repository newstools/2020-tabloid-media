An Osizweni family has been plunged into grief, after a blaze claimed the life of a four-year-old child, in the early hours of Sunday morning, 23 August. KwaZulu-Natal MEC for Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs (Cogta), Sipho Hlomuka sent his condolences to the Mpanza family. “We are heartbroken. We lost a very young child. Just last month our teams responded to a similar incident in Ladysmith where we lost three children and their grandmother as a result of a fire. As a department, we will be coordinating with the municipality to ensure that adequate support is provided to the affected family during this difficult time,” said Hlomuka. Hlomuka has also deployed disaster management teams to support the family and to assist with the investigation of the cause of the fire. It is not clear at this stage, what the cause of the fire was, but Newcastle police will be conducting an investigation. An inquest has been opened. It is said that the blaze started in the early hours of Sunday morning and had completely destroyed the home. The child was later discovered by municipal fire department officials. Hlomuka has also urged residents across KZN to continue to be vigilant and not leave appliances, such as heaters unattended, especially with children present.
