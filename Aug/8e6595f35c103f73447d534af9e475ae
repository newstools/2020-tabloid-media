The South African Medical Association (SAMA) has confirmed that the country’s move to Level 2 of the national lockdown, is a step in the right direction. “This is the correct decision by government and signals a major shift in the country’s response to the Coronavirus. We are happy with this decision and believe it will go some way to begin addressing some of the economic issues that our country currently faces,” said SAMA Chairperson, Dr Angelique Coetzee. Dr Coetzee said that it was particularly important for SAMA, that when President Cyril Ramaphosa announced the move to Alert level 2 on 15 August, he acknowledged the role of doctors and healthcare workers in dealing with the novel coronavirus, and the sacrifices many have made in fighting the pandemic. Coetzee said: “Our doctors are on the frontline of fighting Covid-19 and continue to put themselves and their families at risk every time they leave for work. We applaud these courageous men and women for their dedication and commitment to the health of the nation. We stand with the president in recognising these efforts and similarly express our condolences to those who have died in the service of others.” While supporting Alert level 2, SAMA echoed President Cyril Ramaphosa’s call for people to continue wearing masks, washing and sanitising their hands and practicing social distancing. “It’s extremely important that South Africans understand that we are not rid of this coronavirus and that the road ahead remains long and uncertain. Alert Level 2 is welcomed but people must not think this is the end of the fight against the pandemic. We must all still play our role in curbing the spread of the Coronavirus, and ensure we are all still safe going forward,” said Coetzee.
