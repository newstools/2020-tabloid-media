A Croftdene mother who was left fearful and terrorised by her gun wielding son is receiving counselling following the traumatising ordeal which resulted in the call for help from the police. Captain Cheryl Pillay, Chatsworth SAPS communications officer, said that they recently received a call about a domestic incident involving a mother and son in Croftdene. According to the report, the 20-year-old suspect had broken the windows at their home and was in possession of an unlicenced firearm. “The 20-year-old suspect was arrested for possession of an illegal firearm. Police seized a pistol, ammunition and a magazine which will be sent for ballistics testing. The accused will appear at the Chatsworth Magistrate’s Court in due course,” Pillay said. She added that police offered trauma counselling to the victim and encouraged her to seek help in stopping the abuse. Pillay said that police further offered advise her on processes to be followed with regards to applying for a protection order. Chatsworth SAPS station commander, Brigadier Kevin James, said every life matters and therefore police will not tolerate any acts of criminality. “I continue to encourage victims of gender-based violence and domestic violence to break the silence and seek help. I encourage residents to call the victim friendly facility at the station where trained counsellors will assist them.” Chatsworth SAPS Victim Friendly Facility can be contacted on 031 451 4229 or on 031 451 4267.
