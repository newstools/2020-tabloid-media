The FNB Run Your City organisers have announced the newly launched RYCS 5km Solo Run series which serves as a build up to the RYCS Heritage Day virtual run taking place on Thursday, 24 September. The 5km Solo Run series is sponsored by Puma and will be a free entry event which starts on Friday, 21 August to 18 September. Agne du Plessis, Stillwater Sports head of road running said: “Runners from all over South Africa are invited to partake and stand a chance to win awesome sponsor prizes up for grabs each week for the Friday 5km series.” She said that at the end of the series, one lucky runner will take home the grand prize which will be an impressive PUMA First Mile Hamper and a pair of PUMA Ultra-ride running shoes, to the value of R10 000. “We cannot wait to see all the photographs of runners having fun,”said du Plesis. PUMA marketing director, Brett Bellinger said: “It’s easier to keep fit if you are having fun. The Friday 5km Solo Run Series is a great way to stay active and engaged with the running community. We will definitely be participating and we challenge all SA runners and walkers to do the same,” he said. To be entered into the competition, runners are expected to take a photograph of themselves before, during or after each run. The photograph together with a caption that answers the question. Why do you run? should be posted on social media platforms with the hashtags # FNBRunYourCity; # ForeverFaster and @PUMASouthAfrica. Participants are encouraged to also stipulate the time and date and abide by all government regulations for exercise. At the end of the campaign, the names of the runners that complete all five Friday 5km Solo Runs and share their photographs and captions to the FNB RYCS social media platforms will go into a lucky draw for the grand prize. New runners who want to be part of the Heritage Day Virtual run can visit www.runyourcityseries.com and entries close on 22 September.
