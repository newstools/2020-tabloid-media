Durban Central police have arrested a 40-year-old man for possession of stolen goods. The arrest was made on Saturday, 15 August during a patrol operation in the Durban CBD. “Members were patrolling along Soldiers Way when they noticed a suspicious vehicle with a Gauteng Province (GP) number plate. The members stopped the vehicle for a search and found a suspected stolen cellphone. Upon investigation, the members confirmed that the iPhone had been stolen and the driver of the vehicle was arrested,” said Durban Central SAPS spokesperson Captain Muzi Maphumulo. He said that in another incident on Jacko Jackson Drive, on the same day, the members arrested a man who was found with stolen property which had been reported to the police. “The members stopped a suspicious man who was walking along Jacko Jackson Drive, carrying two car batteries and a street light. When they questioned him on where he got the items and where he was taking them, he failed to account for the items.
The members then contacted the station enquiring about a case which was opened by a complainant about the same items that were stolen from his property. The suspect was apprehended and detained at the station,” Maphumulo said. Again on Saturday, the officers made another arrest in the CBD after they received a tip-off on the transportation of illegal cigarettes. Maphumlo said that the members followed the lead and arrested two males aged 28 and 27, along Russel and St Georges streets. “The members found the suspects in possession of 330 packets of cigarettes amounting to the street value of R11 000. As Durban Central SAPS, we would like to congratulate the members on successful arrests and efforts to curb crime in the in the CBD, making it safe for all,” he said.
