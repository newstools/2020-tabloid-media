It was a momentous Women’s Day for members of eThekwini’s Metro Police after 12 female members were recently promoted to the rank of superintendent, in a field previously dominated by men. Metro police spokesperson Senior Superintendent Parboo Sewpersad said: “This is a first time occurrence within Metro Police. Twelve women is a large number to promote at one go but these are women have shown their worth and we will continue to empower women in this manner. The newly appointed superintendents have been deployed to strategic positions and we commend them on the important role they have to play in policing.” The empowerment continued during the Women’s Day celebrations with an ‘all women’ roadblock held at South Beach under the leadership of Superintendent Zama Dlamini.
As a fun touch to the spectacular event, the Metro policewomen wowed onlookers and trended on social media when they took up the global #JerusalemaDanceChallenge and grooved on the Durban Beachfront to Master KG’s vibey track.
