Burdwan Road is located in the Merebank area known as ‘Chinatown’ and Community Police Forum member, Raj Narain, said violent crime in the vicinity is sporadic and appears to be occurring during the day. “With the prevalence of Covid-19 and lockdown laws, residents who have previously been actively patrolling the area even on foot now keep tabs on crime via Whatsapp crime groups. We try to keep our finger on the pulse in this way to minimise health risks. We are shocked that this incident occurred and it is now an eye-opener for residents to beef up security and remain vigilant. We are thankful that the victim was not injured and the vehicle was recovered. We are grateful to police and security who join forces with residents to keep the area safe,” said Narain. “We need residents to be alert and report all suspicious activities, persons or unknown vehicles that appear to be loitering in the area, to police or to their security service provider. Once this information is quickly relayed, we can act accordingly and possibly prevent a crime.” added Govindasamy.
