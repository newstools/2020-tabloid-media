A shooting outside Cornubia Shopping Mall left a man armed with two pistols dead, on Wednesday. A member of Reaction Unit South Africa (Rusa) was flagged down by a shopper near the Virgin Active Gym at the corner of Allamanda and Tecoma Road in Cornubia at about 4.16pm and informed him of a shooting in progress. Rusa head, Prem Balram, said that the reaction officer responded swiftly and found an unknown male bleeding profusely from a gunshot wound to his body. “Two pistols were found tucked into his belt. Paramedics were despatched to the scene and declared the man deceased upon arrival. According to a witness, two armed suspects opened fire on the victim and fled in an awaiting vehicle. A spent cartridge was recovered on scene. The man was not immediately identified,” Balram said.
