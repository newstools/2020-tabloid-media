Concerted efforts by members of KwaMashu detectives led to a breakthrough when they arrested five suspects aged between 17 and 24 this morning (Monday) believed to be involved in the murder of Newlands East scholar, Renardo Naidu (20) that took place last Sunday. Police spokesperson, Captain Lindani Mdletshe, said: “It is alleged that on Sunday, 26 July at 4pm, victim Renardo Naidu (20) was found with stab wounds on his body, along Dumisani Makhaye highway, next to Siyanda and he was rushed to a local clinic where he was certified dead. A case of murder was opened for investigation. The team worked tirelessly to solve this murder case and the investigation led them to Newlands East where four suspects were arrested. Further investigation led them to a certain house in the Effingham area where a fifth suspect was apprehended. The suspects are expected to briefly appear in the Ntuzuma Magistrate’s Court soon.” Meanwhile, in a separate police operation, a 31-year-old woman is appearing on Monday in the Ntuzuma Magistrate’s Court, following her arrest for murder. “On 2 August at 5.20am, the victim (55) allegedly had an argument with the accused which eventually led to a stabbing on his chest and he was taken to Poly clinic but he died before arrival. A murder case was registered and the suspect was tracked and arrested in the Inanda area,” said Cpt Mdletshe.
