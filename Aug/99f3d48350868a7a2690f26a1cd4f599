A candlelight vigil initiated by the Lite in the Darkness group will be held on Saturday, 15 August from 7pm to 7.30pm, to remember individuals who have lost their lives to the novel Coronavirus, those affected by it and to celebrate people who recovered from the virus. Bernice Pillay who tested positive and made a full recovery from the virus said that this initiative solely entails paying tribute to all who have fought and are fighting against Covid-19. Families have the daunting task of dealing with unforeseen deaths and thus often cannot pay tribute to their loved ones. “Many front liners, including SAPS, doctors, nurses, security personnel and others have lost their lives to the virus. Community members from all parts of South Africa decided to pay tribute and remember them with this support initiative. We request that religious organisations join in and offer their support and prayer. Join our Facebook group, Lite in the Darkness, this is a team effort initiated to support everyone, near and far” Pillay said. The community are encouraged to participate in the vigil by standing at the entrance of their properties with a lit candle. People are allowed to send lanterns up, with the theme song being ‘Heal the World’ by Michael Jackson. Pillay hopes that this initiative can be supported by all, by keeping a light on, and participants can use a candle, cell phone torch or clay lamps to show support on 15 August in the privacy of one’s home. In this way, lockdown regulations are still obeyed. A Facebook page for families of front line members has been created, where photographs and videos of loved ones, and of the candlelight initiative can be uploaded. Ward 70 Councillor, Tony Govender said: “This is to show solidarity to all those who have fought and those who are still fighting Covid-19. We have to stand united in our quest to conquer this silent evil from our midst. I encourage residents to participate in this initiative.”
