Based in the heart of the Durban CBD, ProBono.Org is a non-profit organisation which provides free legal assistance to the financially needy. However, with the advent of the Covid-19 pandemic and the subsequent lockdown and regulations, ProBono.Org has been unable to function via its help desks at various locations in Phoenix, Verulam, Ntuzuma, KwaMashu, Umlazi and surrounding areas in Durban.
Speaking to The Phoenix Tabloid Seshni Govender from ProBono. Org said: “Our passion and commitment to assisting the most vulnerable and marginalised members of society remains as steadfast as ever and therefore staff are working remotely. As such, should you require any assistance with legal matters, you are welcome to contact our staff regarding consumer law, housing and deceased estates matters.” Govender said that in addition to the services mentioned above, senior citizens with minimal estates are able to have their wills drafted for free. They are encouraged to contact the organisation for further information on how to go about getting their will drafted. “It must be noted that the organisation does not deal with any criminal matters. Members of the public are also encouraged to visit www.probono.org.za to access pamphlets which explain basic legal matters and which may be of assistance to clients in determining whether they have a legal matter which requires ProBono.Org’s services,” added Govender. ProBono.org can be contacted on, 067 742 0371; labour, refugee, and family matters on 067 756 8003; general enquiries on 067 739 2265 or email: dbninfo@probono.org.za.
