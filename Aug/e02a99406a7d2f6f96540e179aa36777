The Wellness Centre Trust recently held a free market to allow candidates from their organisation to shop for free and select items from a range of pre-owned donation of clothes, linen-household items and stationary. Founded by Durban North resident, Elios Briggeman, the centre aims to give homeless people a second chance in life. “We are trying to do what we can under the circumstances. We also did a clothing drive for Mandela Day and we had plenty of clothes from donations. We do not like to keep clothes and that is why we hand them out as soon as possible. Before the lockdown, we hosted a free market once a month. We usually put those donated clothing and linen up for market,” said Briggeman. She said that the market aims to restore dignity by allowing homeless people the opportunity to select their own clothes. While the centre welcomes donations for this ongoing project, Briggeman said that items donated must be washed and wearable. “People must please ensure that clothing are wearable and clean. We have had clothes that were donated which were torn and unusable. We do try to wash them but we get a lot of donations and we are limited in the amount of clothes we can wash,” she added. Briggeman added that stationery items for last week Friday’s market were sponsored through a partnership with Prepped 4 Prep. Project manager for the centre, Frank Kiala said 2700 relief packages were delivered during the lockdown. Kiala said: “Since the start of lockdown, we have supplied 2700 food relief parcels to different areas, including Kenville, Amaoti, Inanda, Clearwater, Hammarsdale, Chatsworth, Verulam, Greenwood Park, as well as at Sinikuthando Community Welfare at Mount Mariah and KwaDabeka. Some other food relief parcels were handed out to the Durban North and Windermere car guards. If people can donate non-perishables food towards the relief parcels, it would be more than welcome.” For more information, email Franck Kiala to admin@twet.co.za.
