The KZN Premier Sihle Zikalala has called for all citizens, stakeholders and community leaders in KwaZulu-Natal to play their part in the fight to curb the spread of the Coronavirus epidemic. This after the province surpassed the 100 000 mark of Covid-19 cases with more than 1500 deaths, this week. While the rest of the country sees a steady decline in the number of Coronavirus cases, the number of positive Covid-19 cases in KZN has increased. As at Thursday, 13 August, the number of Covid-19 positive cases in KZN increased to 102 233 with 1563 deaths and 57 525 recoveries reported. Zikalala said the province of KZN has worryingly reported the highest rate of new infections in the country since the start of August, despite all efforts to flatten the curve against the spread. “These worrying figures call for each and every one of us to play their part now. We want to sound alarm bells that we are now right in the storm and on the verge of becoming the epicenter of this deadly pandemic. This literally means many more people are getting infected and many more may die if we do not change our behaviour,” said Zikalala. Meanwhile, the total number of positive Covid-19 cases in the country rose to 572 865, with 11 720 total deaths reported, as at Thursday 13 August. The recoveries are 437 617 which translates to a recovery rate of 76 %.
