Ladysmith Police have warned parents, guardians and teenagers, not to allow strangers into their homes. “Even if you have been communicating with the person on WhatsApp or any other social media platform, do not invite them into your home” said police. This warning comes after a 13-year-old girl was brutally raped in her room, after inviting a ‘WhatsApp friend’ into her home on 27 July . The victim told the police that she knew the man from WhatsApp and did not think anything of it, when he had come to her house. “The victim then showed him her room, where she was raped by the suspect,” said police.  It is believed that the parents were not at home at the time of the rape. The parents were notified about the incident and the police were contacted. Police followed up the leads provided by the 13-year-old teen and the suspect was arrested. DNA  has been taken and will be used to assist with the investigation. The suspect is set to appear in the Ladysmith Magistrate court on charges.
