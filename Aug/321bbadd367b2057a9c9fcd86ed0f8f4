The majority of accredited Hajj operators have refunded Hajj 1441 / 2020 Pilgrims, 100 percent of their money paid for accommodation and airlines based on the cancellation policy. In a statement released on 22 August, the South African Hajj and Umrah Council (Sahuc) said that they are working together with the Department of International Relations and Cooperation (Dirco), the Ministry of Hajj & Umrah and the Muassasah to obtain the balance of the refunds from the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia for the following operators: Khidmatul Awaam, Al Jeem, World of Travel, Shafiq’s, Travel Unlimited, and Yasmine’s Travel. Moaaz Casoo, Secretary General of Sahuc said that if pilgrims have booked with any of the six agents, they should have received 50 percent back from their operator. “If you have not been refunded at all or received less than 50 percent refund, email Sahuc at info@sahuc.org.za. If you have booked with any of the other accredited Hajj operators and have not yet received 100 percent refund of payments made to your operator, contact Sahuc at info@sahuc.org.za and send the last communication made between yourself and the operator, “said Casoo. Sahuc said that all Hajj accredited travel operators for 1441 / 2020 have until 11 September to refund Hujaaj 100 percent of the package value paid. Airline refunds/vouchers must also be processed by this date.
