Five women murdered, one suspect deceased, another released without charge and no closure for the grieving families has left the community of uMthwalume fuming and alleging a cover-up over what is being dubbed as the “sugarcane murders.” The bodies of murdered cousins 16-year-old Nosipho and 25-year-old, Akhona, Gumede were the first to be found in March, followed by the gruesome discovery of the decomposed bodies of Nelisiwe Dube, 22, Zama Chiliza, 38, and the fifth victim, yet to be identified. This sparked outrage as fear gripped the community in the south coast of KwaZulu-Natal (KZN). A manhunt was launched for the elusive killer, leading to the arrest of two suspects. The two arrests were made last weekend but on Monday, 17 August, the prime suspect committed suicide in his holding cell and was found hanged by police. His death is being investigated by the Independent Police Investigative Directorate (IPID). The second suspect did not appear in court after his case was not enrolled, allegedly due to insufficient evidence. According to a statement released by the provincial Department of Social Development the men, aged 35 and 40, were allegedly found in possession of SIM cards and cellphones belonging to the women. Police Minister General Bheki Cele visited the area on Monday, 17 August and addressed the incensed crowd outside court. He informed them that the prosecutors told police that there was strong evidence against the deceased suspect, more than the suspect that was to appear in court. Cele revealed that the now deceased suspect did point out where he had dumped the bodies of the slain women. This, after allegedly confessing that there were bodies to be found, hidden in the sugarcane field of uMthwalume. The community cried out for justice and Cele promised that a full investigation was underway into the accused’s death while police will continue probing the murders.
