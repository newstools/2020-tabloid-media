It seems everyone is excited to be back at the beach, including a 2.47m black mamba which was found in a state of exhaustion on Addington Beach in Durban, on Tuesday. The Metro Search and Rescue Unit contacted the South African Association for Marine Biological Research (SAAMBR) to assist with the bizarre rescue after reports were shared of a large snake spotted on the South Pier, recently. SAAMBR herpetologists Craig Smith and Lesley Labuschagne responded to the call for assistance from Metro Search and Rescue and headed immediately to the beach where they found the unusual visitor. According to Smith and Lauschagne, even though they were prepared to collect a black mamba it was an extraordinary experience rescuing this 2.47m long snake on the beach.
“The snake was so exhausted that when we approached her she hardly even noticed us. She was so easy to handle and thankfully remained calm whilst we transported her back to Ushaka Sea World where our resident veterinarian, Dr Francois Lampen was standing by to assess her condition. “The mamba will remain in the care of uShaka Sea World staff until she regains her strength and is declared fit for reintroduction into a suitable habitat,” said Smith. He thanked the Metro Search and Rescue staff for keeping the extraordinary beach visitor safe until they arrived on the scene. Smith and Labuschagne shared that black mambas are uncommonly found along the coastal belt, preferring deep valley areas with thick vegetation. They are commonly found in areas such as Reservoir Hills, Westville and Krantzkloof, to name a few. They speculated that this particular snake had possibly come down through the canals and rivers that run into the harbour.
