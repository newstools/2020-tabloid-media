 A gang of five masked suspects, wielding firearms, interrupted a family dinner and fled with jewellery, cash, cellphones and a laptop, in Mount Edgecombe, recently. Phoenix SAPS communications officer, Cpt L Naidoo, said: “It is alleged by the victim that his family were at the dinner table when they were rudely interrupted by five suspects wearing masks. They were all armed with firearms. The family members were asked to lay on the floor, while two suspects took the victim to the bedroom. The suspects demanded for cash and jewellery. The victim opened the safe and it was empty. “In the meantime, the rest of the suspects robbed the family members of mobile phones, cash, jewellery and a laptop. One of the family members managed to escape and ran up the road to alert the security company. The suspect that was in the getaway vehicle noticed this and alerted the suspects in the house which prompted them to leave immediately. They got away in a white VW Tauran with an unknown registration. Nobody was hurt in the incident,” said Cpt L. Naidoo. Phoenix CPF chairman, Umesh Singh said that this is terrifying for residents to experience. ” We urge residents to beef up security. Ensure doors and gates are closed. We cannot be complacent about crime or security measures. It is good to note that the suspects did not harm the residents,”
