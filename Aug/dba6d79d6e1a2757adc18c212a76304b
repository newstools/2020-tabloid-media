The sick and elderly will no longer have to stand in spiralling queues for hours on end while waiting to receive their medication as Child Welfare Chatsworth (CWC), in partnership with Cipla Foundation, launched their Sha’p Left pick up point on 24 August. President of CWC, Logan Naidu said that the aim of this new project was to decongest the influx of patients queuing for long hours at the hospital and to give patients an extended time period to collect their medication. Naidu said: “We have partnered up with Cipla Foundation who has put a container on site that will be open six days a week from Monday to Saturday and open from 8am to 4pm. Patients now have the opportunity to walk in and walk out within about a five minute time frame.” Centralised Chronic Medicines Dispensing and Distribution (CCMDD) champion and Pharmacy Supervisor from RK Khan, Shereen Behadar said that the move to becoming a Sha’p Left pick up point is advantageous to patients for faster and safer collection of their monthly medication. “This CCMDD initiative has been extended via the Department of Health where containers are being put up at various pick up points in partnership with Cipla which will be instrumental in assisting patients. Hence, we at RK Khan felt it prudent to have a container fixed onto this premises for the benefit of the surrounding community,” she said. Coordinator of the Sha’p Left pick up point at CWC, Craig Naicker said that patients can now rest at ease knowing that there is no need to rush or flock to the premises as they can come through at any time for their medication. He said, “We’re open six days a week with 14 days to collect your medication. This will make it a ton more convenient for people.”
