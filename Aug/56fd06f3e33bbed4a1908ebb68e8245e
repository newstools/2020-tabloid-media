Durban North police are warning residents to be wary when purchasing vehicles from people who request deposits. This comes after a man was scammed out of R60 000 in cash. According to Durban North SAPS communications officer, Captain Raymond Deokaran, victims are requested to pay a deposit in order to secure a ‘great deal’, only to be left high and dry when it came to handing over the keys of the vehicle. “In a recent case, the victim spotted a vehicle in an advert online. He was invited to meet the suspect in uMhlanga Ridge to view the vehicle, a Corsa bakkie. The victim met with the suspect, inspected the vehicle and said he was willing to buy it. The suspect then asked for a R60 000 deposit which the victim paid. The suspect also accompanied the victim to the licensing department to help ‘complete’ the paperwork. While the victim waited in line, the suspect said he had forgotten documents in the vehicle, he asked the victim to wait while he fetched the documents, however, he never returned,” Deokaran explained. According to the police, this was the 17th case of fraud involving the same modus operandi. “In this case, the victim kept allowing people to go ahead of him in the queue before realising a little while later that he had been scammed. Most of the time, the suspects involved ask to meet in uMhlanga. They have targeted people from all over the province,” he said.
