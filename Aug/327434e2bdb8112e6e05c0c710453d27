A man was gunned down in a hail of bullets while his friend sustained a gunshot to the abdomen in a suspected revenge attack in Mount Royal on Saturday, 15 August. At approximately 1.35pm members of Reaction Unit South Africa (Rusa) arrived on scene and found both men lying in the street. Rusa head, Prem Balram said that one of the victims was shot in the head and abdomen and died at the scene. “The second individual sustained a single gunshot wound to his body. He was stabilised on scene by paramedics from the provincial ambulance service before being transported to hospital. “According to witnesses, four men in a white Toyota Avanza arrived at a tuck shop and purchased cooldrinks. They returned to their vehicle and waited. When they noticed the victims approaching on foot, two suspects alighted from the Toyota Avanza and opened fire on them,” added Balram. Phoenix SAPS communications officer Captain L Naidoo said: “It’s alleged that the victim and his friend were walking on the road when a silver Toyota Avanza approached them and began shooting indiscriminately at the victim. An excess of 21 rounds were fired. “The victim demised at the scene with multiple gunshots mostly on the head. His friend sustained a single injury to his stomach. He is in a serious but stable condition in hospital. The motive seems to be vengeance at the moment.”
