To mitigate the spread of the second wave of the novel coronavirus, President Cyril Ramaphosa announced on Monday during his address to the nation that many beaches across the country would be closed-off throughout December, however in KwaZulu-Natal there will only be a partial closure affecting peak days. The announcement by the president comes amid a flood of new Covid-19 infections that have engulfed South Africa. He said that all beaches and public parks will be closed on 16, 25, 26 and 31 December and once again on 1, 2 and 3 January 2021 in KZN. The number of confirmed coronavirus cases in SA climbed to 866 127 on Monday, with nearly 8 000 new cases reported. The number of new cases has increased from a daily average of 3 800 to over 6600 a day with Eastern Cape, Western Cape, KwaZulu-Natal and Gauteng as the four provinces leading the second wave. “The festive season poses the greatest threat to the health and well-being of the nation and to the recovery of the economy. If we do not do things differently, we will greet the new year not with joy, but with sorrow. Unless we act responsibly now and adhere to the basic precautions, we will face a bleak new year,” Ramaphosa said. He said that given the rate of growing coronavirus cases, if we do not act urgently, the second wave will be more severe than the first wave. Ramaphosa said most of the new infections are among young people, in the age group of 15 to 19 years. Measures to prevent super-spreader events
