The owner and driver of a taxi, Mandakwe Professor Khumalo, 35, who resides in the Cornfields (Estcourt area) was brutally gunned down in the forecourt of a garage in the Winterton area, in the early hours of Saturday morning, 12 December. One other person was also injured in the shooting. It is alleged that the motive for the killing is about a dispute within the Kimberly Long Distance Taxi association. According to witnesses, the taxi departed from Kimberly Taxi rank on 11 December and was refused to load passengers as an argument ensued at the rank. After the heated argument the taxi drove off, heading along the N3 towards the Winterton area. It is believed that a white Mercedes Benz followed them into the garage, when the shooting took place. Khumalo was rushed to Emmaus hospital, but sadly he passed away in the taxi before reaching the hospital. A case of murder is being investigated by the Winterton Police. No arrests have been made.
