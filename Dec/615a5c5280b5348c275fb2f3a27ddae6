Parkview Primary School has launched an ‘Adopt a Child’ initiative to help with the dire financial constraints that they are currently facing, due to unpaid fees. Based in Woodhurst, a majority of the pupils in the schools come from low income households who are struggling to make ends meet. The Covid-19 pandemic has further intensified their need for financial help as the school has been forced to stop all fundraising events which assisted maintainance. Mr Y Perumalswami, school principal, said that due to Covid-19, many parents have lost their jobs and are unable to pay their school fees in full. “They are unable to feed their families let alone pay for school fees. Furthermore, there are a number of learners who come to school without lunch,” he said. The school’s roll for 2020 is 162, with no fees paid from over a hundred pupils. Perumalswami is appealing to kind-hearted individuals as well as business and companies, to come forward and adopt a child by paying their school fees. “The funds raised from this initiative will be invested back into our children, as they will be the leaders of tomorrow,” he said.
