To improve service delivery in Jacobs and to revitalise the area, it was agreed at a recent workshop that an integrated enforcement team to operate as a centralised complaints management system, would be established by November. Ethekwini municipality confirmed on 1 December that the team has materialised and has embarked on its first operation recently. Eurakha Singh, senior manager of the South Durban Basin Area Based Management Unit, said the revitalisation of industrial areas is seen as crucial to the city as it brings with it investment by businesses, contributes to employment, increases property values and contributes to the city’s rates base. “It also creates opportunities for growth and job creation. Jacobs has been selected as a pilot for the programme, with a view to utilise lessons learnt and best practises in two other identified areas for the projects namely Prospecton and New Germany,” said Singh. However Desmond Aubrey Snyman, ward 68 councillor raised concern. He said: ” I am concerned. It would be good to know when this integrated enforcement team has started and in which part of Jacobs are they working. As recent as last week I have been informed by people who are working in the Jacobs area of the illegal dumping that’s taking place. That’s very unhealthy and unacceptable, if we are seriously looking at integrated enforcement and not seeing any visibility of enforcement taking place.” Snyman explained that a clean up is definitely needed at the corner of Dudley Street and Thorn Road, were the monument is. “This place has now become a dumping ground for various companies and residents who have forgotten to take their domestic dirt out on time for the Durban Solid Waste (DSW) truck to pick up. I am appealing to all members of the community to stop illegally dumping and start taking pride by keeping our community clean. After all cleanliness is next to godliness, ” said Snyman
