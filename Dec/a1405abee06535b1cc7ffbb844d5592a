The Hope for Africa Foundation has been on a 620km trek to raise awareness about the lack of appropriate footwear for children in disadvantaged communities. On their Northern Natal challenge when the team reached Ladysmith, they were joined by the Alfred Duma Municipal mayor Vincent Madlala, along with other officials and councillors on 20 November. Hope for Africa chief executive Jabulane Thabethe said: “This is an initiative aimed to raise awareness about the lack of appropriate footwear for children in disadvantaged communities. This is an issue that has long existed in our society, where many children today, still walk to and from school with shoes in dire conditions or even worse, without any shoes at all.” The Foundation started their challenge on 11 November in Katlehong, Gauteng, ending in Durban. To date, the initiative has helped over 4500 children since its inception in 2016. The Hope for Africa Foundation is a non-profit organisation and its members share a passion to uplift and empower the youth. “Our greatest goal is to break innate poverty cycles and the inequalities that exist through education, sport and recreation as well as skills development programmes,” said Thabethe. Thabethe said the days have been long and hot, but the communities and municipalities, including Ladysmith and its people, have made the challenge worthwhile with every step taken. This is the fourth such challenge that the Foundation has undertaken. Mayor Madlala said: “I thank the brave men and women who participated in this challenge for their sacrifice made and for creating the awareness. We give them our support.”
