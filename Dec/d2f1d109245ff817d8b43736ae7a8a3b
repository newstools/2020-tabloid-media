Radio Al Ansaar Breakfast Rush and Outreach visited the St Martins Orphanage for a day of fun and games. The kids were each given a shoe box which comprised of clothing and other goodies that were purchased by the staff of the Al Ansaar foundation and the community at large. Outreach were shocked to find out that some of these kids were abandoned in parks, having spent nights alone with their siblings until St Martins came to the rescue. Nichal Sarwan of the Breakfast rush questioned as to why the sudden increase in the number of children at the orphanage this part of the year, only to discover that many kids are abandoned at this time of the year. “It is quiet depressing to see the longing for a family in these kid’s faces,” said Outreach Co Ordinator Swaleha Shaik. “Seeing the excitement of the kids opening their party packs, having their face painted, jumping carefree in the jumping castles, giggling to the clown and opening their gift boxes gave us a sense of satisfaction to be able to put a smile on these deserving kid’s faces.” TBR and Outreach would like to thank all businesses and the community for their support in this initiative.
