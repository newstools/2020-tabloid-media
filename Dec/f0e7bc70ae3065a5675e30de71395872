Overport was abuzz on Saturday afternoon following the Covid-19 Operation Lockdown event hosted by the eThekwini Central Cluster CPF. The event was dedicated to the frontline workers and victims who succumbed to Covid-19 as well as those who overcame the virus. It also marked the launch of the Community in Blue strategy Imtiaz Syed, chairman of eThekwini Central Cluster CPF said: “The event was aimed at showing respect and appreciation to frontline workers who have been assisting during the Covid-19 pandemic and in respect of families who have lost their loved ones due to the virus as well as reigniting the fire of activism through safety within the community.” Syed said that the event also spoke about active community policing and requested that all 42 stations that are part of the eThekwini district join hands in fighting crime. “The concept is simple, each and every police station area should have their CPF as well as the Community in Blue patrollers standoff as a collective at the entry and exit points of their areas.” He said that the importance of this event was to unite all in the fight against crime, especially gender-based violence. “We must fully understand that communities have many leaderships and through this we act to unite in them and bring them to understand that the fight is one.” Syed said that with the fight against crime being highlighted, they firmly believe that homelessness and vagrants on the roadside are a major issue that the community is facing. “We have advised the community to not give money to the homeless but to rather support them sustainably,” he said. Syed added that the community welcomed the controlled aspect of the initiative and hopes that those who attended and assisted during the event gain unity and strength.
