Police are requesting anyone with information about two bank robberies in the uThukela District, to come forward. The first robbery took place on 28 November when a bank along Harding Street, Estcourt was robbed.  It is believed that when the bank staff reported for work, they detected a strong smell of “something being cut by an angle grinder.” On closer inspection it was discovered that an unknown number of suspects had entered the bank through the roof and cut open the safes. The second robbery occurred on Thursday morning, 10 December, after a bank in Murchinson Street, Ladysmith, was robbed. Police say that the robbers gained entrance through the roof and took a sustainable amount of money.  It is believed that the same modus operandi was used to gain entrance into the two banks. No arrests have been made.
