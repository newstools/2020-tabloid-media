President Cyril Ramaphosa, on 3 December, declared Nelson Mandela Bay a coronavirus hotspot and extended the national state of disaster to 15 January 2021. He explained about the state of the coronavirus pandemic in the country and urged the nation to contain the two pandemics of Covid-19 and gender-based violence and femicide. Ramaphosa said the global pandemic continues to cause devastation and resurgence of the coronavirus with some countries experiencing second waves worse than their initial peak. He said South Africa had fallen from fifth place with the highest number of infections in the world, to 14th place. “Despite the progress SA has made, we have always known that a second wave of infections is possible. There is now clear evidence of a resurgence of infections in parts of our country, which, if not confronted decisively and directly, could lead to great suffering and death,” said Ramaphosa. As of 3 December the confirmed coronavirus cases in South Africa are 800,872 with 21,803 Covid-19 deaths. 92 per cent have recovered. Ramaphosa said there have been a rise in new infections and an increase in hospital admissions with Nelson Mandela Bay and the Sarah Baartman District in the Eastern Cape and the Garden Route District in the Western Cape accounting for most of the new infections.
The rise in transmission is due to people travelling between and within provinces in higher numbers due to the festive season. In the case of the Garden Route, this applies to the movement of seasonal workers. Social, cultural and religious gatherings in large numbers, in venues with poor ventilation and so-called “after tears” parties at funerals adds to the rising infections. He said: “The most urgent task before us right now is to contain the rise in infections in the affected districts in the Eastern Cape and Western Cape, and to ensure that a similar situation does not develop in other parts of the country.” A resurgence plan developed with the World Health Organization is set in motion, effective immediately. Testing, contact tracing, isolation and quarantine will be expanded. Awareness campaigns are being stepped up. Ramaphosa called for a change in behaviour to prevent a resurgence of the virus.” We need to do all we can to keep the economy open and to push ahead with our reconstruction and recovery effort.” he said. Additional measures in coronavirus hotspots The Nelson Mandela Bay Metropolitan Municipality has been declared a coronavirus hotspot. In addition to the existing Alert Level 1 regulations, additional restrictions will apply in Nelson Mandela Bay Metro: The National State of Disaster is extended to 15 January 2021. All existing Level 1 restrictions remain throughout the country.
“We have all the tools we need to prevent resurgence in the rest of the country. We can only do this if everyone plays their part,” said Ramaphosa. • Law enforcement officials will ensure compliance of regulations such as social distancing and wearing of masks.
• Passengers in taxis to wear masks.
• Each one of us to comply with the curfew times. Vaccine
SA participating in the World Health Organization’s Covid-19 Global Vaccine Access Facility, the Covax facility – which aims to pool resources and share vaccine development risk. The Solidarity Fund will contribute R327 million towards vaccine procurement. Ramaphosa said until a vaccine is developed and distributed, we remain our own best protection against Covid-19. He urged all to download the Covid Alert SA mobile app. He said with the festive season approaching, many will travel to reunite with friends and relatives. He urged all to avoid unnecessary travel, wear a mask in public transport, keep the vehicle windows open and maintain prevention measures. Ramaphosa said social gatherings can be ‘super-spreader’ events that can transmit the virus. He urged precautions to avoid spreading the virus to our families, especially the elders by keeping gatherings small, outside or in well ventilated venues, ensure social distancing and wear masks. “We cannot return to the darker days of June and July, when transmission of the virus was widespread and the lives of our family and friends were at risk,“ said Ramaphosa.
