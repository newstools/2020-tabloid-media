After the devastation caused by the coronavirus pandemic this year, some festive cheer and a celestial wonder brings 2020 to a close. A vibrant planetary alignment called a “great conjunction.” and popularly known the “Christmas Star”, is currently visible in the evening sky as the bright planets Jupiter and Saturn come together, culminating on the night of 21 December. “You can imagine the solar system to be a racetrack, with each of the planets as a runner in their own lane and the Earth towards the center of the stadium. From our vantage point, we’ll be able to see Jupiter on the inside lane, approaching Saturn all month and finally overtaking it on 21 December,” said Henry Throop, NASA astronomer. According to NASA what makes this year’s spectacle so rare is that its been nearly 400 years since the planets passed this close to each other in the sky, and nearly 800 years since the alignment of Saturn and Jupiter occurred at night, as it will for 2020. This year, they will pass 10 times closer to each other on 21 December, during an event called a “great conjunction.” allowing nearly everyone around the world to witness this spectacular event. Astronomers use the word conjunction to describe close approaches of planets and other objects on our sky’s dome and specifically for Jupiter and Saturn because of the planets’ top-ranking sizes. Jupiter will look like a bright star and be easily visible from Earth. Saturn will be slightly fainter and will appear slightly above and to the left of Jupiter. On December 21, Jupiter will overtake it and they will reverse positions in the sky. The planets Jupiter and Saturn will be so closely aligned on 21 December, that they will create what looks like a radiant star and can be seen from South Africa. Followers of the Christian faith believe that it is the Christmas Star which the three wise men followed to find the newborn baby Jesus. The spectacle is being dubbed the cosmic miracle that couldn’t come at a better time.
