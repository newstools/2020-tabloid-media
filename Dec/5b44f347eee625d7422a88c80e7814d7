A Phoenix mother’s instinct to act as a human shield in a brutal assault on her son has left her with multiple serious injuries and a shattered 
self-esteem. In the throes of the highly-publicised ‘16 Days of Activism For No Violence Against Women and Children campaign, the loving mother had her scalp split, face brutalised and suffered a concussion with various other injuries throughout her body leaving her traumatised and deeply vulnerable in the assault which unfolded at Bromvale Place, Rydalvale, recently. Speaking to The Phoenix Tabloid, the emotional mom, who wished to remain anonymous said: “I just reacted as a mother when I saw my son being beaten up. I intervened and placed myself in the line of attack to protect my child. What is shocking is that the gang who provoked the attack are known to us and they showed no mercy. “I still hear the words ‘kill her, kill her’, echo in my head. I feel the blows raining down on me and the heavy tug on my head when a matric female pupil grabbed my hair and dragged me on the tar. I cannot erase the feeling of excruciating pain as my skin rubbed violently against the tar and my head felt ripped apart,” she said. According to the angry complainant, her 19-year-old son was returning from the shop when he was confronted by known residents on the road. “Those people taunted my son and then unleashed their wrath on him. As a mother, I rushed to my son’s defence when I heard about the beating. My son also sustained various injuries including head wounds. “I am horrified that known people can behave in such a ruthless and barbaric manner. It is disgusting how a young woman lifted her hands to hit a mother. What kind of child behaves in such a way,” she added. The complainant registered a case at Phoenix SAPS. Captain L Naidoo, communications officer at the police station confirmed that a case of common assault is under investigation.
