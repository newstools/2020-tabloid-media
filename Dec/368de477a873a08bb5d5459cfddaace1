To boost their charity shop sales, the Highway Hospice is currently facilitating their silent auction. This auction that started from 5 December and will be running until 12 December is to sell the many donations received from the public and different organisations. Sheryll de Janger from the charity shop said: “The reason we started these auctions is that we receive a lot of  donations of collectable, antique or just interesting items, and we were not sure of how to price these items, one of our customers suggested we run a silent/written auction and that way the item would fetch its price.” De Janger said that they held their very first silent auction in April 2008 which had a total of 76 Lots. The number of people who registered for the auction was 68 and they raised R17 220. “As time went on some of our donors started donating their goods specifically for the auction and we can now happily say that we have over 300 Lots per auction and over 200 registrations. The auctions now bring in between R120 000 to R150 000 depending on what stock availability we have,” said de Jager. To start off the auction, North Durban Lions Club hosted a drop-off zone at their club on Saturday 5 December for seven charities of which Highway Hospice was one of the selected charities. “We were really grateful for this initiative and would like to thank Kim van Wyk the President of the North Durban Lions Club and his team for putting this together,” said de Jager. The items sold on the auction are categorised from A-K, the public is welcome to go on the organisation’s Facebook page: Highway Hospice to look at the items sold in the different categories. The bidding runs from 9am to 3pm on Monday to Friday, and 8.30am to 12pm on Saturdays.
