In the wake of the 16 Days of Activism For No Violence Against Women and Children Abuse campaign, the gross injustice against women continues unabated with a female claiming she was raped at a Phoenix residence after she was promised a domestic worker position, recently. Captain Louise Naidoo, Phoenix SAPS communications officer said that the complainant alleged that she was looking for a domestic job around the Ottawa residential area when a man who was parked on the side of the road called her and offered her a domestic job cleaning his house in Phoenix. “The complainant and the ‘prospective employer’ agreed on a R1000 salary payment and proceeded to his alleged residence. On arrival at the Phoenix home, the address which the victim cannot remember, the proposed employer allegedly raped the victim and sent her on her way,” Naidoo said. She said that a case of rape is under investigation. Phoenix police urgently warns women who are seeking employment to be wary of criminal-minded people who are not averse to taking advantage of vulnerable individuals. “We understand that these are desperate times and jobs are few and far between, however, women need to be cautious and vigilant. “There are vicious and vile individuals out there who will pounce on unsuspecting women because they can determine their desperation. Safeguard yourselves and do not fall for the scheming ploys of ruthless individuals,” added Naidoo. Umesh Singh, Phoenix Community Police Forum (CPF) chairman said: “This is absolutely horrific to hear after all the information about violence against women that has been imparted. It is even worse to know that a man could take advantage of a woman in a vulnerable situation. “We urge women to please refrain from being too trusting and remain alert in the face of such ruthless individuals who manipulate and hurt innocent women.”
