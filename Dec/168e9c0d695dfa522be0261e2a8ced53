Residents from Lilac and Himalaya roads in Shallcross have voiced their grievances regarding a scrapyard dealer who has been operating in the area. The concerned resident raised the issue at a meeting held with the Ward 71 Civic Association on 1 December. The meeting was attended by Crossmoor Civic chairperson, Julian Moodley and DA councilor Tony Govender as well as eThekwini Metro Police, town planning and the fire department. Fatima Ismail, DA branch chair of ward 71, said the scrapyard dealer is operating in a residential area and many residents are concerned about the well-being of the community. “Having such a business in a residential area has the potential to attract criminals and residents fear for their safety,” she said. The owner of the scrap yard was given a stipulated amount of time to submit all relevant paperwork regarding having a scrapyard in a residential area or face removal.
