An “urgent” call was made recently by the Siyandawesthe (SWS) to the government to improve the rate of efficiency, legitimacy and transparency towards assisting gender- based violence, HIV/Aids, as well as unemployment, particularly youth unemployment. The organisation marched to the Alfred Duma Municipal Town Hall to hand over a memorandum in this regard to Mayor Vincent Madlala and
the Department of KZN Economic Development and Tourism. “These issues affect each community in every way, which includes financial pressures that lead to high crime rates,” said Siyanda Makhwaza of the SWS, who led the group of down Murchison Street to the Town Hall. Sithembiso Khumalo, also from the SWS, said that the memorandum stated that if
a person was interested in creating their own employment, that capital and investments are injected into these ideas and assistance is given to those that want to improve their livelihoods. Recent data released by Stats SA in the month of September indicated that there was a to the negative impact of Covid-19. “SWS have faith in the social intervention programmes introduced by the government and other private non-profit organisations but also understand that to increase impact and efficiency of these various initiatives community engagement then becomes essential and a sustainable economy is one of the many factors that contribute to these programs being successful,” said Khumalo.
