Tongaat police are investigating an armed robbery case after an undisclosed amount of cash was taken at a supermarket in the CBD last Thursday. One suspect was shot dead and two security officers wounded when a cash-in-transit robbery struck a Shoprite U-Save supermarket. It is alleged that the robbers opened fire on the cash-in-transit guards while they were walking from the supermarket in Fairbreeze to their armoured vehicle. Captain Nqobile Gwala, provincial police spokesperson said that the Tongaat SAPS are investigating the incident. Paul Herbst of IPSS Medical Rescue, said that they received numerous phone calls from witnesses, just after 4pm, and attended to the scene. He said that when they arrived, paramedics found a security guard from the cash vehicle and another guard with gunshot wounds. A third person was fatally wounded and later it was confirmed that the dead person was a suspect. “The deceased was found further up the road. He was grazed on the head by a bullet. The two guards who were wounded were treated at the scene by the paramedics,” said Herbst. The recent robbery comes after two security guards were left wounded when robbed of an undisclosed amount in cash boxes by five men while depositing cash at an ATM in a supermarket in Pinetown on 5 October. One guard was shot on the leg while the other shot on his buttocks. The suspects managed to run away with four cash boxes.
