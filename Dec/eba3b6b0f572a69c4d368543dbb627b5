The uThukela Municipality has come under fire after a 12-year-old Umbulwane girl drowned in an unnatural lake. The water collected over months from a burst water pipe that resulted in children using it as a swimming pool. Residents collect water there for home use and animals drink from it. Residents of the rural town, which is an extension of Steadville just outside of Ladysmith, said that a group of children were gathering often to play in the water that steadily collected from the burst pipe. “The water is clean and many of our animals and even we go and collect the water for
use at home,” said a bystander watching in shock as residents had pulled the 12-year-old from the water that is about an adult’s waist deep. Paramedics declared
the child dead at the scene. Although it has not been officially disclosed on how the child drowned, residents speculate that the child got trapped in the mud below along with water pressure and fell over. “We reported this to the uThukela Municipality, but nothing has been done. Children are always playing around the water hole and going in on hot days. We never thought that something like this would happen. I think if the pipe had been fixed, maybe the child would be alive today,” said another resident. “None of our councillors or leaders are here to see what is really going on, not only is water being wasted, but on the other side raw sewage is filling up the streets and our children are playing in it.”
