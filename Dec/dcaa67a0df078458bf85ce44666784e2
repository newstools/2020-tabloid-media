The community of Odeke were overjoyed when 71-year-old Kemphus Zindela who is deaf and mute was found extremely dehydrated by members from Port Shepstone Search and Rescue and K9 SAR in the Odeke area, on Wednesday, 16 December. Zindela had gone missing on Saturday, 12 December. K9 Bear and Ferie and search and rescue officers spent most of the time on their knees as they crawled in a dense overgrown bush area in search of Zindela. Bear and Ferie pointed out that the missing Zindela was alive. “We are so grateful for the police officers help, as we searched since he had gone missing,” said community members. Zindela, according to police, was extremely excited and could not believe that police officers had found him. He was carried out by officers as he was too weak to walk back.  Zindela was then taken to Turton clinic for further treatment. Community praised the officers for their work done and still find it hard to believe that he was found alive.
