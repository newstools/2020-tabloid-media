The South African Insurance Association (SAIA) is urging all drivers and road-users to exercise restraint and avoid drinking and driving during this festive season to minimise fatalities on South African roads. According to the Road Traffic Management Corporation (RTMC), research shows that drunk-driving accounts for 27.1 percent of fatal crashes in the country and estimated to cost the local economy R18.2 billion annually. The research also highlighted that 55 percent of fatal crashes happened at night and about three out of five happened over the weekend. Viviene Pearson, CEO of the SAIA said: “Road safety is a major challenge in South Africa, one that requires a multisectoral, multi-governmental approach that is evidence-based to reduce this increasing burden. An important aspect of this approach is that humans make mistakes, but these mistakes do not, and should not, result in a fatality or a serious injury on the road.” Pearson said that all road-users must take caution this festive season period, to curb fatalities on the road by planning their road trips ahead of time, ensuring that their vehicle is in a good, road-worthy condition to travel long distances, as well as getting enough rest or sleep before embarking on the journey. “Leave your car at home and call an e-hailing service or use an option that may be included in some insurance policies where you can access a “drive me home” service after an event.
We urge all road-users to obey traffic laws and to be vigilant on the roads this festive season to ensure their safety, their families’ and that of other road-users. We wish all road-users a safe and happy holiday,” said Pearson.
