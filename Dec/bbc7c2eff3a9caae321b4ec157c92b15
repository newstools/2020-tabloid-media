Shoppers and retail workers were left terrified after a woman was shot and killed during a business robbery on Gopalall Hurbans Road in Tongaat. It is alleged that the two robbers opened fire on their way out of the business premises, fatally wounding the woman. Captain Patrick Ngwane, Tongaat SAPS spokesperson, confirmed the incident. He said that the police are investigating cases of murder and business robbery. Prem Balram of a private security company Reaction Unit South Africa (Rusa), said that their Tongaat operations centre received multiple calls from neighboring shops reporting the incident. “Our members were dispatched on the scene at about 5.04pm to the clothing store, where a foreign national was found lying on the floor. The victim had sustained a gunshot wound to her chest and died at the scene,” he said. Balram added that two men were seen by witnesses fleeing the scene shortly after a gunshot was fired.
