A highly emotional young man,19, claimed he attempted to end his life by running into oncoming traffic on the R102 in the vicinity of Phoenix, on Tuesday, after he was ostracised by his community for allegedly contracting the Covid-19 virus. The Reaction Unit South Africa (Rusa) Phoenix operations centre received multiple calls from passing motorists informing the controller on duty that they had to avoid the individual who suddenly ran onto the road. Prem Balram, Rusa head said that reaction officers were hastily dispatched to the location provided at approximately 11.42am and questioned the teenager who said that he intended on ending his life due to him testing positive for Covid-19. It is alleged that news of his results was allegedly leaked to residents of Zwelisha where he lived. According to Balram, the teenager further alleged that members of the community chased him out of the area and threatened to assault him. “He claimed that the news of his test results was shared on a national radio station. It could not be immediately confirmed if he was suffering from a mental disorder. He also changed his version of events leading up to his attempted suicide several times,” Balram said. He added that Phoenix SAPS transported the teenager to a place of safety.
